** Part A: ** Open the hands and turn the palms to face you, left hand above the right. While turning your hips and shoulders to the right, shift your weight to the right foot, pivoting on the left heel to the right until your feet are in a &#8220;pigeon-toed&#8221; position. Shift your weight back to your left foot and stand up straight.

** Part B: ** Step straight with the right foot, keeping your weight on the left. As you shift your weight forward and square your hips, bring the right arm down, to the right, and up again in a big circle, making a fist as the forearm reaches its final vertical position in front of you. At the same time, bring the left forearm down in front of you, making a fist as the arm reaches its final horizontal position. (Figure 47.1)
