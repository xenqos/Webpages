** Part A: ** Pivot the right foot out 90 degrees on the heel, and shift your weight onto it by straightening the left leg. Lower your weight by bending the right knee, and go down as far as is comfortable without forcing. As you go down, lower the arms above the knees, keeping the hands in the &#8220;Single Whip&#8221; position. (Figure 75.1)

** Part B: ** Pivot the left foot 45 degrees to the left on the heel. Shift your weight onto the left foot, turning the hips to the left and bringing the right arm in front of you to cross under the left arm, both palms down.
