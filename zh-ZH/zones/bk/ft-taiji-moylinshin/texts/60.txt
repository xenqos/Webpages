** Part A: ** Turn your hips to the left and bring your left arm straight up behind you (palm up). Your right arm stays in the forward position. Take a larger step back with your right foot, again at 45 degrees to the right, and shift your weight onto it. At the same time, pivot the left foot on the heel 90 degrees to the right, and swing your arms to the right by turning the upper body until your left arm is over your left foot. Shift your weight onto the left foot and bring your right arm under your left to hold the ball as you stand up. (Figure 80.1)

** Part B: ** Step straight ahead with your right foot and square the hips as you shift your height to the right foot and extend the right arm straight ahead, palm up. Your left arm presses downward by your left leg. (Figure 80.2)
