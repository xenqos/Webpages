Keeping your weight on your front foot, bring your left foot a half- step forward and put it down flat at a 45 degree angle. Shifting your weight onto the back foot, stand up raising your right hand, palm out, and bringing your left hand back to the left. Step forward slightly with your right foot, placing only the heel on the floor. Rotate your forearms till the palms face each other while moving your left palm to your right elbow, dropping both elbows and squaring your hips. (Figure 81.1)
