Progressive Knockout (PKO): In a PKO tournament, a portion of the buy-in goes towards a bounty on each playerâ€™s head. When a player is eliminated, the player who knocked them out receives a portion of that bounty. The "progressive" aspect means that as players are eliminated, their bounty increases. For example, if you knock out a player, your own bounty may increase by a certain amount, making you a more valuable target for other players.
