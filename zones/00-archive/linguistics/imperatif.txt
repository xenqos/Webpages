Special Note with -ER Verbs (like parler) in the tu form:

For most -ER verbs, you drop the final -s in the tu form:

    Tu parles → Parle !

    Tu regardes → Regarde !

    But: Tu finis → Finis ! (No change for -IR or -RE verbs.)

However, if the verb is followed by "en" or "y", you keep the -s for easier pronunciation:

    Parles-en !

    Vas-y ! (from aller — notice it keeps the “s”)
