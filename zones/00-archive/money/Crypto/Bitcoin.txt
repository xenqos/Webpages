## Node

[-
is Bitcoin client
is computer connected to Bitcoin network
runs Bitcoin program
keeps block of confirmed transactions
keeps copy of blockchain
-]

## Transactions

[-
TXID - transaction ID
fresh
confirmed
-]

## Memory Pool

[!
Temporary storage for transactions, received by a node.

## Block

[!
Collection of bitcoin transactions.
Candidate block - temporary block created using transactions selected from the memory pool.
Block starts life as a candidate block. After successfully mined blocks is added to the blockchain.

## Blockchain

[-
consists of blocks
is ledger of confirmed transactions

## ScriptPubKey

[-
controls how spend Bitcoin
Locking Script - locks Bitcoin until someone provides answer to unlock
Unlocking Script - ScriptSig (Legacy), Script Witness (SegWit)
-]

The ScriptSig is the part of a transaction which contains the required signatures and the script which unlocks a UTXO for spending. A ScriptSig pairs with the ScriptPubKey to form a complete and valid script. The ScriptSig is only present in legacy Bitcoin transactions. In SegWit transactions, the ScriptSig is removed from the transaction body and called the Witness Script.

When bitcoin is sent, it is locked using a ScriptPubKey. The ScriptPubKey can be thought of as a riddle, solvable only by the owner of the correct private keys. To spend this bitcoin, the owner must publish the answer to the riddle by signing the transaction with his keys. The published answer to the riddle is the ScriptSig.

Every node verifies that the ScriptSig matches the ScriptPubKey for each transaction they receive, ensuring that no invalid transactions are added to the blockchain. One of the major changes implemented in SegWit was the relocation of the ScriptSig from the legacy transaction body into the Witness portion.
