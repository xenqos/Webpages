Ideal Unemployment.
Natural Unemployment.

## NAIRU - Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment
Corresponds to level of unemployment when real GDP equals potential output.
Inflation Threshold. Inflation does not rise or fall when unemployment equals Natural Unemployment.

## Typical Lengths of Unemployment

## Efficiency-Wage Theory
The market-clearing wage is the wage at which supply equals demand.
There is no excess supply of labor (unemployment) and no excess demand for labor (labor shortage).
In the long run the economy will achieve this market-clearing equilibrium and will experience the natural level of unemployment.

### Avoiding shirking.
Difficult to measure the quantity or quality of effort.
Paying efficiency wage to increase cost of job loss.

### Minimizing turnover:
If job performance depends on workers' ability, firms with higher wages will attract more able job-seekers, and this may make it profitable to offer wages that exceed the market clearing level.
