Shift your weight to your right foot, turn the hips 45 degrees to the right, and raise your left toes. Turn the left foot 45 degrees to the right and put it down flat again. Keeping your arms up, shift your weight to the left foot and toe a half-step directly to the right with your right foot, placing only the heel on the floor. Keeping your weight on your left foot, square your hips, drop both elbows and rotate your forearms until the palms face in, left palm opposite the right elbow. (Figure 5.1)
