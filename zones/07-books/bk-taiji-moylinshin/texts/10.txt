Half-step forward and put it down flat at a 45 degree angle. Shifting your weight onto the back foot, stand up raising your left hand, palm out, and bringing your right hand back to the right.

Keeping your weight on your right foot, square your hips, drop both elbows and rotate your foream1s until the palms face in, right palm opposite the left elbow. (Figure 12.1)
