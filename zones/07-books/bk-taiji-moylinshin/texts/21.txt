Turn your right palm toward your face and drop your right arm down and back, and raise the left arm in front of you. Turn your hips 45 degrees to the right. With both arms straight and level at shoulder height, left palm forward and right palm up, step straight ahead with your left foot, keeping your weight on your right. Push straight ahead with your right palm, and down to your left knee with your left palm, while shifting your weight forward and squaring your hips. (Figure 27.1)
