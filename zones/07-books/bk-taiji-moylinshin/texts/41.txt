Step forward with the right foot (keeping the weight on the left leg), and lower the arms crossing them at the wrists in front of you, palms up (Figure 49.1). As you shift your weight forward and square your hips, swing both arms down, out to the sides, and up again in a circular motion, making fists with both hands as the forearms reach their final vertical position in front of you. (Figure 49.2)
