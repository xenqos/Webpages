** Part A: ** While shifting your weight onto your right foot, drop your hands down, tum the palms up and pull them up and off to the right. Stand up straight on your right leg while placing the ball of your left foot on the floor a half-step in front of your right foot. Pinch the five fingers of your right hand together bending your wrist and pointing down and place your left hand in the crook of your right elbow, palm facing out. (Figure 91.1)

** Part B: ** Keeping your weight on your right foot, step forward with your left foot. While shifting your weight forward rotate your left hand, push forward and square your hips. Do not change the position of the right arm and hand. (Figure 91.2)
