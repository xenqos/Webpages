** Part A: ** Take a half-step backward with your right foot and place it down pointing 45 degrees to the right. Shift your weight back and separate the arms by pushing the palms out at shoulder height, arms forming a circle in front of you. At the same time, raise the left heel and straighten the left foot by pivoting on the ball of the foot. (Figure 101.1)

** Part B: ** Step with the left foot-- towards the South West comer. (Figure 101.2). As you shift your weight onto the left foot and square the hips, turn and push both palms outward, the right arm extending straight out at shoulder height and the left arm higher and at an angle, protecting your forehead.
