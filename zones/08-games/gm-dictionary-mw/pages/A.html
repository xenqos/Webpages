For example, a tournament might be specified as $200+$100R+$100A, that is, $200 buy-in, $100 rebuys, and a $100 add-on, or $33+R+A., that is, $33 buy-in plus $33 rebuys and a $33 add-on. Sometimes expressed as a number followed by an A, such as, for example, 1A, which means “one add-on.” <strong>4.</strong> Able.</p>

<a name='name.A010'>&nbsp;</a><h2>according to Hoyle</h2>
<p>With respect to the rules of poker, proper, that is, following the rules. The expression has moved from the world of poker to general usage in the English language as a vague phrase invoking authority. Named for Edmond Hoyle.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.A011'>&nbsp;</a><h2>ace</h2>
<p>The highest or lowest card in the deck. If the cards are arranged in order, the ace either starts this sequence: A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-T-J-Q-K; or finishes this one: 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-T-J-Q-K-A. In high poker, the ace is the highest card in a hand, with one exception: when it is part of a 5-high straight, that is, in this hand: A-2-3-4-5, of mixed suits (where it must be the lowest card to make the straight). In low poker (ace-to-five lowball), especially as played in California cardrooms, the ace is the lowest card in a hand. In high-low (split) poker games, the ace is either high or low, depending on how it is used. It can even be both high and low in some hands. For example, <q class='c'>7</q><q class='c'>4</q><q class='c'>3</q><q class='c'>2</q><q class='c'>A</q> is a 7-low hand, and an ace-high flush. Also called <em>bullet</em>, <em>bull</em>, <em>rocket</em>, <em>seed</em>, <em>spike</em>, and other names.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.A012'>&nbsp;</a><h2>ace high</h2>
<p>In high poker, a no pair hand whose highest card is an ace. “I have ace high; can you beat that?” (Also, “I have an ace high; can you beat that?” The difference is that word “an.”) “Yeah, I got a pair of deuces.”</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.A013'>&nbsp;</a><h2>ace-high</h2>
<p>A term that often modifies (refers to) a straight or flush topped by an ace. “I was drawing to an ace-high flush, but all I made was an ace high.”</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.A014'>&nbsp;</a><h2>ace-high straight flush</h2>
<p>Royal flush.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.A015'>&nbsp;</a><h2>ace in the hole</h2>
<p>In a stud game, having an ace as one’s downcard or one of one’s downcards. This being a desirable condition, the expression has moved from the world of poker to general usage in the English language with the wider meaning of an advantage or resource kept in reserve until needed.</p>

<a name='name.A018'>&nbsp;</a><h2>ace-little</h2>
<p>In hold’em, describing an ace accompanied by a small card, usually a 7 or smaller.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.A019'>&nbsp;</a><h2>ace magnets</h2>
<p>In hold’em, K-K as starting cards, sardonically named because pocket kings are involved in (too) many bad beat stories involving confrontations with aces.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.A020'>&nbsp;</a><h2>acepots</h2>
<p>A form of high draw poker, usually found in home games only, in which a player cannot open the pot without holding at least two aces as openers. Compare with jackpots.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.A021'>&nbsp;</a><h2>ace out</h2>
<p>To win (perhaps by bluffing) while holding an ace high hand (that is, a relatively worthless hand (at least in draw poker), since it doesn’t contain even a pair). This expression has moved from the world of poker to general usage in the English language with the meaning of winning by deception or just barely beating someone in some venture. (If your opponent holds a totally worthless hand, an ace-high hand would just barely beat him; that is, you would <em>ace</em> him <em>out</em>.)</p>

<p>Ace-to-five lowball.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.A030'>&nbsp;</a><h2>ace-to-five lowball</h2>
<p>The version of lowball draw, once popular in California (but played in many other areas), in which the lowest card is the ace, and straights and flushes have no significance. The best hand is A-2-3-4-5, sometimes called a <em>wheel</em> or, less commonly, a <em>lowball</em>. Usually the joker is set as the lowest unpaired card in the hand (a very few clubs play ace-to-five lowball without the joker). The game is played bet-or-fold before the draw. <em>Ace-to-five lowball</em> is also sometimes called <em>California lowball</em>, particularly when the sevens rule is in effect (but all ace-to-five games do not necessarily have the sevens rule). Also see deuce-to-seven. Sometimes called simply <em>ace-to-five</em>. Sometimes shortened to <em>A-to-5 lowball</em> or <em>A-to-5</em>.</p>

<a name='name.A036'>&nbsp;</a><h2>across</h2>
<p>When you just barely lift the right edge of your drawn card (see squeeze, definition 1 or 2) in lowball such that you can see only the rightmost vertical edge and only down to but not including the index, for any card ace through 10 you see either none, one, two, three, or four vertical pips (see pip). <em>Nothing across</em> is an ace, 2, or 3; <em>two across</em> is a 4 or 5; <em>three across</em> is a 6, 7, or 8; and <em>four across</em> is a 9 or 10. Similar to the discussion under spotter, some lowball players couple the knowledge that a card could be in one of these ranges with game theory to decide on whether or not to bet.</p>

<a name='name.A037'>&nbsp;</a><h2>act</h2>
<p>Make a poker play at the required time; bet, call, raise, or fold, as appropriate, in turn. When it’s your turn to do something, someone might say, “It’s your turn to act,” or, “It’s up to you to act.”</p>

<a name='name.A039'>&nbsp;</a><h2>action</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The relative liveliness of a game, often measured by the frequency and quantity of bets and raises. “This game has a lot of action.” Often part of the phrase <em>fast action</em>. <strong>2.</strong> Being required to act. When it’s your turn to do something, someone might say, “It’s your action,” or, “The action is up to you.” <strong>3.</strong> That portion of the pot that a player short of the full bet can win a multiple of. For example, in a no-limit game, if John bets $100, Matt calls the whole $100, and you call, but you have only $20, you are said to have $20 worth of <em>action</em> in the pot. A side pot of $160 ($80 from each of them) will be created between John and Matt; $20 of John’s bet goes into the main pot, as does $20 of Matt’s bet, and all of your bet; you can win the $60 main pot if you win. <strong>4.</strong> A player’s investment, current or potential, in a pot or game, particularly as part of the phrase <em>take someone’s action</em>. For example, in a $20-limit ace-to-five lowball game, the button has killed the pot. Matt, in the middle blind, cannot play. Susie shows Matt her cards prior to throwing them away. She has 4-5-6 and does not want to put in another $30 and possibly face a raise. Matt says, “Play, and I’ll take half your action.” That is, he will give her $15 to play those cards. Whether he would put up half the cost of a subsequent raise and possible action after the draw is not at all clear. Besides, such backing of a hand is not usually permitted, and, furthermore, Matt probably was not serious. <strong>5.</strong> A player’s investment, current or potential, in a pot or game, particularly as part of the phrase <em>take someone’s action</em>. action Also, if I have staked someone in a game, I have a <em>piece of his action</em>. <strong>6.</strong> Part of the phrase in action. — (adj) <strong>7.</strong> Lively, usually loose or liberal. “He’s an action player.” “This is an action game.” Also see give action.</p>

<a name='name.A041'>&nbsp;</a><h2>action button</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong> A bet that must be posted, in a seven-card stud or Omaha 8-or-better game (or, sometimes more specifically, the button — definition 3 — signifying that the holder must immediately make the bet), by the winner of a scoop pot above a certain size. For example, if the low card normally must bet $1 in a $5-$10 game, and there is an action button out, anyone who calls the $1 is committing to bet $5 later. No one would call the $1 without intending at least to call the blind raise by the action button. Whether the action button acts in turn, or after everyone else has acted, depends on the cardroom. Posting an action button is not the same as a kill (definition 3). <strong>2.</strong> Advance action button. <strong>3.</strong> A button placed by the house dealer in front of the hand that will compete first against the player dealer in California games such as <em>pai gow poker</em>.</p>

<p>In many cardrooms, with respect to an all-in bet, only a full bet is considered a legitimate wager, in terms of whether this constitutes a raise that can be reraised. Anything less than a full bet is considered to be <em>action only</em>, that is, other players can call such a bet but not raise it. For example, Lili bets $10. Henry calls. John goes all in for $14. When the bet gets back to Lili, she is permitted only to call the extra $4; the same goes for Henry. John’s raise is called <em>action only</em>. See discussion at full bet.</p>

<a name='name.A120'>&nbsp;</a><h2>angle</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong> A maneuver, on the border between legality and illegality (but usually clearly unethical), to take unfair advantage of another player. Extreme example: Some clubs consider putting fewer chips than required into the pot an uncompleted bet that is not valid until completed, and that, furthermore, can be removed until such time as sufficient chips are bet. (Fortunately, there aren’t many such clubs.) In such a club, you bet $100 and another player puts in $99. You show your cards, which have him beat. He says, “I put in only $99; I didn’t call your bet.” He withdraws the chips. Of course, if he had you beat, he would quietly take the whole pot. If someone pointed out at that juncture that he called only $99, he would probably say, “Oh, pardon me, just an oversight; I meant to call,” add the missing chip, and <em>then</em> drag the pot. All of that is part of an <em>angle</em>. See angle shooter. Another example: In a no-limit game, the holder of the big blind might say to the small blind, “If no one else comes in, you put them all in blind and I’ll call you.” Everyone folds to the small blind, who puts in all his chips without looking. The big blind, already looking at this cards, calls. The small blind says, “Hey, you’re looking. We agreed to go all in blind.” The big blind says, “That’s all right. I had already committed. It doesn’t make any difference if I look now.” However, if the big blind didn’t like his cards, he would say, instead, “Oh, I forgot we agreed on that and I already looked.” Another angle is deliberately miscalling one’s hand in an attempt to get the other player to fold a better hand. When caught, the perpetrator claims to have misread his hand. — <strong>2.</strong> Perpetrate an angle. More commonly <em>shoot an angle</em>.</p>

<a name='name.A121'>&nbsp;</a><h2>angle shooter</h2>
<p>A poker player who uses various underhanded, unfair methods to take advantage of inexperienced opponents. The difference between an angle shooter and a cheat is only a matter of degree. What a cheat or thief does is patently against the rules; what an angle shooter does may be marginally legal, but is neither ethical nor gentlemanly. Nor is it in the spirit of the game. Unfortunately, poker is not a gentleman’s game. In addition to learning how to protect yourself against cheating players, you must learn to watch out for the angle shooters. See angle.</p>

<a name='name.A154'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Arizona hold’em poker</h2>
<p>A casino game, banked by the house, dealt from one deck, in which players do not compete against the dealer. The game is related to hold’em in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. (See nonpoker games.) It is also very similar to Let It Ride Bonus. Each player has three betting areas marked A, 1, and 2. Each player makes an ante bet in betting area A. Each player receives three cards face down, and two cards are dealt face down as community cards, which will be used by each player to make a five-card hand. Players then look at their cards. Each player decides in turn to continue betting, or stop at just the ante bet. To continue, a player places a bet equal to the ante bet in area 1. The first community card is then turned over. Again each player who has made another bet decides in turn to continue betting, or stop where he is. To continue, a player places a bet equal to the ante bet in area 2. At this point, each player has made one, two, or three bets. The second community card is then turned over. The dealer reveals each hand in turn. If the player does not have a pair of 10s or higher, he loses all bets. Winning payouts are: royal flush, 250:1; straight flush, 50:1; four of a kind, 25:1; full house, 12:1; flush, 10:1; straight, 8:1; three of a kind, 3:1; two pair, 2:1; pair of 10s through aces, 1:1.</p>

<a name='name.A190'>&nbsp;</a><h2>avatar</h2>
<p>In an online cardroom, the graphical representation of a player while he is seated at a table, presented in the form of a caricature at his seating position at the table. Some sites predefine avatars and assign them to specific seats, some allow players to choose from a predefined (but limited) collection not tied to specific seats, while still others allow players to upload their own images, which can then be seen by all participants and viewers. (These uploadable images are technically not avatars, but are mentioned for completeness.) Some sites also allow players to turn on or off the representation of avatars; when turned off, a player sees only iconic representations of players (as, for example, circles or disk-shaped figures).</p>

<a name='name.A192'>&nbsp;</a><h2>average stack size</h2>
<p>In a tournament, the average number of chips remaining per player, calculated by dividing the total number of chips in play by the number of remaining players. For example, if a tournament had a starting field of 500, and each started with $10,000 in chips, then the total number of chips in play would be $5 million. If 100 players remained, the <em>average stack size</em> would be $50,000.</p>
