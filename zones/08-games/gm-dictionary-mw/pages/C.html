<a name='name.C016'>&nbsp;</a><h2>California games</h2>
<p>A set of cardroom games, formerly called&nbsp;<em>Asian games</em>, some of which resemble poker, but are not strictly poker, in which players place bets before receiving the hands on which they wager; others resemble blackjack or baccarat. In these games, to get around the legal restriction against banking games, the only interest the house has is to take a portion of every bet; one player (or a consortium often known as a&nbsp;<em>corporation</em>) acts as banker (usually called the&nbsp;<em>player banker</em>), playing one hand against each player in turn. These games include pai gow (played with tiles, and not a card game at all), pai gow poker, super nine (also called super pan nine), California blackjack (also called&nbsp;<em>X</em> blackjack, where&nbsp;<em>X</em> is the name of the club or company that invented the game variant), California Aces (a variant of blackjack in which the object is to get closest to 22, with two aces being the best hand; similarly often called&nbsp;<em>X</em>aces),&nbsp;13-card (not played with a banker), and others. Sometimes shortened to&nbsp;<em>Cal games</em>.</p>

<a name='name.C028'>&nbsp;</a><h2>called hand</h2>
<p>A hand that someone bet and someone else called, as opposed to a hand that was bet and no one called. The term often comes up when a bet is made, called, and lost, and the bettor who lost the hand now wants to throw the cards away unshown (perhaps from embarrassment at being caught bluffing). Someone, often someone not involved in the hand, wants to see the losing cards, and cites the (often unwritten but nonetheless usually enforced) rule, “A called hand must be shown upon request.” (Some players, particularly those most used to private games, are under the mistaken impression that only the winner of a pot has the right to ask for a called hand to be shown.) The situation can also arise when someone bets, someone calls, and the bettor mucks his cards as acknowledgment that he was bluffing, and the caller undoubtedly had him beat. The winner of the hand often shows his cards, but not always, particularly in a fast-moving game. The hand that won the pot is still, however, a called hand, and must be shown if anyone asks. Both situations come up more in draw games than other forms of poker, but the term still applies to all games. When a&nbsp;side pot is involved, usually all&nbsp;active hands at the showdown are&nbsp;<em>called hands</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> The rule followed in many cardrooms that what a player says about his hand has no relevance: only the cards shown are of importance, and those cards, when placed face up on the table, are to be “read” by the house dealer, or any player at the table. The rule is invoked in two situations. In the first, a player can say what he likes about his hand, but it is what he actually shows down that determines the winner of the pot. (The opposite situation is also common, particularly in California, where some clubs hold that if a player miscalls his hand as being better than it is, he may lose claim to the pot; that is, the verbal announcement takes precedence over the actual cards.) The second situation is for high-low split games. In home games, high-low split is often played with a verbal or chip&nbsp;declaration, with half the pot going to the person who declares high&nbsp;<em>and</em> has the best high hand, and half to the person who declares low and has the best low hand. In cardrooms, though, the situation is usually&nbsp;<em>cards speak</em>: at the showdown, all&nbsp;active players lay their hands face up on the table, and the pot is split between the actual highest and lowest hands (or all of it given to the one hand that combines both, if such exists, or the hand that wins the high half when no hand qualifies — see&nbsp;qualify — for low); the house dealer, if there is one, reads all the hands at the showdown and determines which wins the high half and which the low. (If there are&nbsp;qualifiers for both high and low, the situation is still&nbsp;<em>cards speak</em>: the pot is split between the highest and lowest hands that meet the conditions of the qualifiers. If no hand qualifies for low, the highest hand wins the whole pot; if there is a qualifier for high and no hand qualifies for high, the lowest hand wins the whole pot; if no hand qualifies for either, the pot is sometimes split among all participants. Local rules may differ.) Sometimes part of the expression&nbsp;<em>cards speak for themselves. </em>Also see&nbsp;8-or-better.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> A name for&nbsp;high-low split with no&nbsp;declaration.</p>

<a name='name.C113'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Caribbean Draw Poker</h2>
<p>A house-banked casino game played at a blackjack-type table. The game is related to poker in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. Players first ante and then players and dealer all receive five cards face down. Players can also make an additional optional jackpot wager, in which certain hands at the end will be eligible for payouts. Players elect in turn either to fold, and lose the ante, or play, in which case they put up an amount double the ante wager (the back bet). A player who plays can then replace up to two cards. After each player makes a decision, the dealer reveals his whole hand. A dealer’s hand must&nbsp;qualify (be a pair of eights or better). If it does not, the player receives even money on the ante and the back bet is a standoff. If the dealer’s hand does qualify, and his hand is higher than the player’s hand, that player loses both the ante and back bet. If the player’s hand is higher, the player wins even money (1:1) on the ante wager and a bonus amount based on the back bet wager, up to some maximum payout (often $5,000), from a payout table that starts with even money for one pair and ranges up to 100:1 for a royal flush. The jackpot wager is then paid separately, whether or not the player’s hand has beaten the dealer’s. These payments come from a separate payout table, with hands ranging from a flush to four of a kind receiving fixed payouts, a straight flush 10 percent of a progressive jackpot, and a royal flush 100 percent of the jackpot. In a variant known as&nbsp;<em>VIP-poker</em>, a player pays one ante to draw one card and two antes to draw two. In another variant, a player pays one ante to add (rather than replace) a sixth card to his hand, and then play the best five of these cards.</p>

After each player makes a decision, the dealer reveals his whole hand. A dealer’s hand must&nbsp;qualify (be ace-king or better). If it does not, the player receives even money on the ante and the back bet is a standoff. If the dealer’s hand does qualify, and his hand is higher than the player’s hand, that player loses both the ante and back bet. If the player’s hand is higher, the player wins even money (1:1) on the ante wager and a bonus amount based on the back bet wager, up to some maximum payout (often $5,000), from a payout table that starts with even money for one pair and ranges up to 100:1 for a royal flush. The jackpot wager is then paid separately, whether or not the player’s hand has beaten the dealer’s. These payments come from a separate payout table, with hands ranging from a flush to four of a kind receiving fixed payouts, a straight flush 10 percent of a progressive jackpot, and a royal flush 100 percent of the jackpot. Often known simply as&nbsp;<em>Caribbean Stud</em>. A variant of Caribbean Stud exists in which a player may replace one card, at the expense of invalidating the bonus bet.</p>

<a name='name.C118'>&nbsp;</a><h2>carry over</h2>
<p>Credit a&nbsp;stake player or a&nbsp;cow with his chips from one shift to the next. A stake player is usually liable for the amount of his last&nbsp;press. For example, if Smiley was staked $20, lost it, given a $10 press, and then carried over, only $10 would go on the&nbsp;sheet of the next shift. In such case, a stake could lose for the house and still make money for himself. (If he was picked up or otherwise ended the next shift with $20, he would be given $5 when he was split out, because on that shift he showed a $10 profit. But the house would have lost $15, representing the initial $20 minus half the $10 profit on the second shift.) If the stake were given $20, and then a $10 press, and went broke while still in the same shift, he would have no&nbsp;<em>carry-over</em> and could not make money on that shift. That is why some stakes try to get staked near the end of a shift, and then, if they are short near the end of the shift, contrive to lose the last chips so they can get pressed just before the next shift starts. That way they can start the next shift with just $10 on the sheet, and, if they lose that, get still another press.</p>

<a name='name.C141'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Casino Hold’em Poker</h2>
<p>A house-banked casino game dealt from one deck, in which players play separately against the dealer. The game is related to&nbsp;hold’em in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. Each player makes an ante bet. In addition, each player can make an optional&nbsp;<em>AA</em> bet, a side bet based on the value of the player’s two cards and the first three flop cards, with a flush or higher paying 25:1 and a pair of aces to a straight 7:1. Each player and the dealer receives two cards face down and three community cards are dealt face up, which will combine with the player’s and dealer’s hole cards to form a five-card hand for each. At this point, each player must either make a call bet, which is double the ante bet, or fold, in which case he loses the ante and the AA bet. The dealer then puts out two more community cards and reveals his two downcards. The dealer must have a pair of 4s or better to qualify. If the dealer does not qualify, then the player wins the ante and pushes on the call. If the dealer qualifies and beats the player, the player loses both ante and call. If the dealer qualifies and the player beats the dealer, then the player wins both ante and call. Regardless of whether the dealer qualifies, if the player beats the dealer, the ante pays a bonus, usually per the following: any straight flush, 20:1; four of a kind, 10:1; full house, 3:1; flush, 2:1; straight, 1:1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Any of several house-dealt games in which players compete against the house to either beat the dealer’s hand or just try to make certain hands, which pay off according to pay tables. These games are not like “traditional” poker in which players compete against each other, and are “poker” only insofar as poker comes into play for the purpose of ranking hands. These games have a fixed house edge and involve little, if any, skill, since players make their bets before receiving their cards. Although in some of the games players can make further wagers after seeing their cards, they are not playing against each other, and the betting to build pots or to bluff others out are not part of the games. Examples include&nbsp;<em>Caribbean Stud</em> and&nbsp;<em>Let It Ride Bonus</em>.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Poker played in a casino (as opposed to a&nbsp;private game);&nbsp;public game.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Poker&nbsp;<em>as</em> <em>played</em> in a casino, that is, the style or rules used in such games.

<a name='name.C145'>&nbsp;</a><h2>casino stud poker</h2>
<p>A house-banked casino game popular in European casinos played at a blackjack-type table with seven players, dealt from a single standard deck of cards. Each player first antes, by putting a wager (within the range of table limits) into the ante box before him, and then players and dealer all receive five cards face down, with the exception of the dealer’s last card, which is turned face up. Each player in turn decides whether his hand can beat the dealer’s. To do so, the hand must&nbsp;qualify. To qualify, a hand must contain at least an ace and a king. Hands rank exactly as in poker (but there the similarity to poker essentially ends), ranging all the way from no pair to a royal flush. The player has two choices. He can surrender the hand, by announcing “Passe,” and give up the ante bet. He can elect to have his hand challenge the dealer’s, by announcing “Relance” (continue), and place double the ante bet into the relance box. After all players have indicated their intentions, the dealer reveals his hand and compares it with each of the remaining player hands. Two possibilities exist. The dealer’s hand does not qualify, in which case the dealer pays even money on each ante bet and the relance bet is a push (it neither wins nor loses). The dealer’s hand does qualify, in which case the dealer compares his hand with each player’s hand. If the player’s hand beats the dealer, the dealer pays the player even money (1:1) on the ante wager and a bonus amount on the relance bet, ranging from even money for one pair through 100 times the relance bet for a royal flush. Unlike poker, if the player and the dealer have the same rank of hand, it is a push. For example, if player and dealer each has a flush, it is a push, no matter the values of the individual cards. However, the better three of a kind, full house, or four of a kind wins. Thus, for example, the hand <q class='s'>K</q><q class='d'>K</q><q class='h'>K</q><q class='c'>A</q><q class='h'>9</q> beats the hand <q class='s'>J</q><q class='d'>J</q><q class='h'>J</q><q class='h'>A</q><q class='c'>Q</q>, but the hand <q class='s'>A</q><q class='s'>K</q><q class='s'>T</q><q class='s'>9</q><q class='s'>4</q> is a push against the hand <q class='h'>8</q><q class='h'>6</q><q class='h'>4</q><q class='h'>3</q><q class='h'>2</q>. One additional option exists, one that is somewhat analogous to the bluff in cardroom poker. A player can win without his hand beating that of the dealer, but to do so must make an extra wager. That is, if the player’s hand does not qualify initially, the player can still elect to put out the relance bet, gambling that the dealer’s hand will not qualify. At the time of hand comparison, if the dealer’s hand does not qualify, the player wins the ante bet (as before), and the relance bet is a push. If the dealer’s hand does qualify, the player loses both the ante and the relance bet. An optional bet is available in some casinos, in which the player wins for a flush or better, with payouts ranging from 50:1 for a flush to 5,000:1 for a royal flush. A variant of casino stud (sometimes called “Extra Plus’) exists in which a player can replace one card, at the expense of invalidating the bonus bet. Known in German-speaking countries as&nbsp;<em>Bärenpoker</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Check on the last round of betting; often referring to the lack of a bet made by the last player able to do so.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> In a tournament, what two players implicitly agree to do when another player is all in before the final card, that is, not make any further bets, realizing the all-in player is more likely to bust out against two players than one who might be driven out by further betting, and thus increasing the chances for both of them to advance in the&nbsp;payout schedule.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.C231'>&nbsp;</a><h2>check out</h2>
<p>Fold in turn even though there has been no bet. A (usually unkowledgeable) player does this when holding a hand that he thinks cannot possibly win. Such action is against the rules in some cardrooms, and considered improper behavior and poor poker etiquette in all, because folding when not faced with a bet can affect the outcome of the pot. For example, a player might be inspired to bluff against only one remaining player whereas he might not have done so against two, or a player might have what he considers to be a second-best hand that he is afraid to bet suspecting that the particular player was on a draw, but with that player now out of the hand, he can bet with impunity, thus putting an unfair burden on the other remaining player.</p>

<a name='name.C294'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Chowaha</h2>
<p>A hold’em variant invented in a private game by&nbsp;RGPer Mike Chow, and popularized at&nbsp;BARGE, in which each player gets two downcards, the dealer flops nine cards, arranged in three rows of three, then turns two cards vertically at the ends of the “corridors” between the preceding rows, and rivers one card in the middle and to the right of the two, the whole arrangement forming a large arrow-like structure. Players form their best five-card hand using their two downcards plus any three cards from the four possible five-card board combinations: top row of three plus top card of two plus river card, bottom row of three plus bottom card of two plus river card, middle row of three plus either one of the two turn cards plus river card. The game is usually played high-low, with an 8&nbsp;qualifier for low; a player need not use the same board for both high and low. Variants include playing the game high only, and each player starting with four cards (in which case, as in Omaha, exactly two must be used to form the five card hand). The high only version played with only two downcards, which is how the game is played in cardrooms, is known as&nbsp;<em>casino Chowaha</em>, as opposed to&nbsp;<em>home Chowaha</em>.</p>

<p>A form of poker found only in home games, a&nbsp;widow game in which each player receives five cards face down, as does a central area of the table, followed by a round of betting, and then the dealer turns up each central card, one at a time, each followed by another round of betting. At the showdown, each player uses the best five cards among his five and those of the widow. The game is often played high-low split. Also called&nbsp;<em>Utah, Lamebrains</em>, or&nbsp;<em>California. </em>Southern Cross is a variant of Cincinnati.</p>

<a name='name.C382'>&nbsp;</a><h2>come</h2>
<p>The anticipation of making a hand. In lowball, this is usually whatever you’re drawing to; in high (draw, stud, or hold’em), it is usually four cards to a straight, flush, or straight flush; usually preceded by&nbsp;<em>on the</em>. To&nbsp;<em>raise on the come</em> means to start with four cards to a good hand that is not yet made, and raise before the draw or before the arrival of the next card to build a larger pot, with the hope of making the hand and having a larger pot to bet into after the draw or in a succeeding round, or as a&nbsp;semibluff. A player who starts with A-2-3-4-K in&nbsp;ace-to-five lowball and raises is raising&nbsp;<em>on the come</em> (because, if called, he will discard the king and draw one card to an excellent hand). In hold’em, a player with two of a suit as his downcards and two more of that suit in the flop who bets (or raises) is also doing so on the come. To&nbsp;<em>bet on the come</em> in draw poker usually means to make a blind bet after the draw after having drawn one card to a&nbsp;come hand.</p>

<a name='name.C430'>&nbsp;</a><h2>concealed hand</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> In seven-card stud, a hand whose existence is a surprise based on the player’s board. For example, a player with a board of four apparently unrelated — that is unpaired and not likely to be part of a straight or flush — cards can have a concealed full house or four of a kind.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> A hand played in such a way that you would not suspect it of being very good, but that turns out to be so. For example, if, in lowball, two players kept raising each other back and forth, and a third just kept calling all the bets, you might suspect that he was drawing one to a good hand. If he turned out to have a pat wheel, that would be a<em>concealed hand</em>. In any poker game, if one player lets the others do all the betting for him, usually because the situation allows him to just keep calling without ever having to make a raise or leading bet of his own, and that player actually holds a hand that cannot lose, he is said to have a&nbsp;<em>concealed hand</em>. Also called&nbsp;<em>hidden hand</em>.</p>

<a name='name.C435'>&nbsp;</a><h2>consecutive declaration</h2>
<p>In a&nbsp;high-low split game, a method of indicating, prior to the showdown, whether you’re going for high, low, or both. In home and private games, such&nbsp;declaration is usually done simultaneously, by everyone, for example, opening his hand at once to reveal none, one, or two chips, representing, respectively, low, high, or both ways (sometimes called&nbsp;<em>scoop</em> or&nbsp;<em>hog</em>). In some games, however, at the time for the declaration, players declare one at a time verbally starting to the left of the dealer; this is called&nbsp;<em>simultaneous declaration</em>. This, of course, gives the dealer a tremendous advantage. (Sometimes consecutive declaration starts with the last player to bet or raise, or, if no one did so on the last round, with the highest&nbsp;board.) Declaration, whether simultaneous or sequential (consecutive), is not common in public cardrooms, where high-low split games are usually played in what is called&nbsp;cards speak.

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.C469'>&nbsp;</a><h2>counterfeited</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> In a&nbsp;high-low split community card game, having one of your low cards duplicated on the board, thus considerably weakening your hand, because it is now much easier for another player to tie or beat the hand. For example, in Omaha, you hold A-2-7-9, and the board is 3-4-8. At this point you have thenut low (8-4-3-2-A). The turn produces a 2. You now hold a 7 low (7-4-3-2-A), but you have potentially been&nbsp;<em>counterfeited</em> because someone holding A-5-X-X has a wheel.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> In high (either straight high or the high half of high-low), having a probable winner turned into a probable loser by the appearance of another card on the board. For example, you have two low spades in hold’em, and three medium spades appear on the flop. Your hand is very likely the best. If another spade appears on the turn or river, anyone holding one spade higher than your two will beat you. Or, you hold <q class='s'>4</q>&nbsp;<q class='s'>5</q>, and the flop is <q class='h'>6</q><q class='d'>7</q><q class='c'>8</q>. You have a good hand at this point, because, while possible, it is not likely that another player holds 9-10. If a 5 or 10 falls, anyone with a 9 beats you. If a 9, anyone with a 10 beats you. In all of these cases, you have been&nbsp;<em>counterfeited</em>. For both meanings, also called&nbsp;<em>duplicated</em>.</p>

<a name='name.C480'>&nbsp;</a><h2>courtesy bet</h2>
<p>A bet made in a situation in which a bet is not mandated, and sometimes implying a bet that should not be sensibly made. In a no-limit hold’em game, Curly has bet every round and Matt called. On the river, Matt, who had a good draw but just made something like middle pair, says, “I’ll give you a courtesy bet.” The bet is small, and the implication is that Curly will now raise. A courtesy bet often occurs in the same situation in which a&nbsp;protection bet is made.</p>

<a name='name.C481'>&nbsp;</a><h2>courtesy play</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Giving someone action where it is not necessarily warranted. For example, in a hold’em game, you have beaten someone in several large pots. Now you have the blind. He opens for a raise from the small blind. You have garbage cards, something like 7-2 offsuit. Normally you would not call the bet, and would just throw the hand away. Instead you take decidedly the worst of it in order to appear to “give” him back a few of the many dollars you won from him. This is a&nbsp;<em>courtesy play</em>.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Playing in a particular cardroom as a favor to the owner or management. “First cardroom I ever played in was the Pastime Club. Biggest game they have is $5-$10. Every time I come into town, I give them a courtesy play before I go over to the Fantasy for the $200-$400 game.”</p>

<a name='name.C482'>&nbsp;</a><h2>covered</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Having more than enough chips to meet the current bet; usually heard in a no-limit game. For example, in an all-in situation, if the winner of the pot has $1,000 and the loser less than $1,000, the winner is said to have the loser&nbsp;<em>covered</em>.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> By extension, “I’ve got you covered” means “I call your bet.”</p>

<a name='name.C483'>&nbsp;</a><h2>cow</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Go half and half with a player on his buy-in to a game; usually preceded by&nbsp;<em>go</em>; sometimes followed by&nbsp;<em>up</em>. When the player quits, he splits with the person with whom he&nbsp;<em>went cow</em>. Sometimes the house goes cow with a player to enable him to get into a larger game than he could otherwise afford, generally with the nonaltruistic purpose of filling what would otherwise be a shaky game. At some point when the player (the house hopes) gets far enough ahead of the game, the house may split him out (see&nbsp;split out), that is, remove half of his chips and&nbsp;<em>put him on his own</em> (see&nbsp;put [someone] on his own). In some games, the players object to chips leaving the table (in fact, there is often a house rule against that), so the player has to cash out to split out. “Will you cow up with me, so I can get into the $20 game?” — &nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> The half-and-half proposition just described; often part of the phrase&nbsp;<em>make a cow with</em>. Also&nbsp;<em>vaca</em>.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong>Someone playing cow. “There are four stakes, two cows, and one live one in the game.”</p>

<a name='name.C500'>&nbsp;</a><h2>crazy four poker</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;nonpoker game, banked by the house, that resembles poker only in the ranking of the hands, dealt from one deck, similar to&nbsp;three-card poker (definition 2). Each player and the dealer receives five cards from which to make four-card poker hands (with four-card straights and four-card flushes as ranking hands, and hands ranked thus: four of a kind, straight flush, three of a kind, flush, straight, two pair, pair, high card; ace is high except in A-2-3-4); only the best four cards in each hand are used to determine winners. Two equal bets must be made, ante and super bonus. The super bonus bet pays off for a straight or better per a posted payoff table. An optional queens up bet pays for two queens or better per a posted payoff table. Anything less loses the bet. After seeing his hand, a player can either fold or stay in the game by making a second bet equal to the ante (the play bet) — or up to triple the ante if the player has a pair of aces or better — and then his hand competes against the dealer’s. If the player does not make the play bet, he loses the original bet. If the dealer does not have a qualifying hand of king or better, the player is paid even money on the ante and nothing on play. If the dealer does qualify, then hands are compared. If the dealer wins, the player loses both ante and play. If the player wins, the ante and play are both paid at even money. Regardless of whether the dealer qualifies or whether the player beats the dealer, super bonus and queens up bonus hands are paid according to the payoff tables. The super bonus bet pushes when the player has less than a straight but beats or ties the dealer’s hand. Also see&nbsp;play four poker.</p>
