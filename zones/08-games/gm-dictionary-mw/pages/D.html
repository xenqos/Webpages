<a name='name.D021'>&nbsp;</a><h2>dead</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Pertaining to a hand that won’t win if it’s made; usually preceded by&nbsp;<em>draw</em>. In hold’em, you might hear, “He flopped a full house, and I was drawing dead to a straight. Naturally, I made the hand.” — &nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Not lively, referring to the action in a game; often as part of the phrase&nbsp;<em>dead game</em> or&nbsp;<em>dead spread</em>.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Not legally playable (according to the house rules in force at the time, or to generally accepted rules). “His hand is dead. I saw a discard touch it.” “That’s a dead hand; you didn’t have the blind last time.” The second quotation refers to cards that would normally be playable, but because of a technicality cannot be played. In this case, the cards are unplayable because in many cardrooms a player who did not sit through the blinds is not entitled to a hand.&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> Describing a card or cards not available to be drawn because they have already appeared. In seven-card stud, if you have four spades and you can see eight spades among other players’ board cards, you might say to yourself, “My spades are dead.”&nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> Not catching any cards, usually phrased as&nbsp;card dead.</p>

<a name='name.D025'>&nbsp;</a><h2>dead button rule</h2>
<p>The rule that the button doesn’t move if the small blind position leaves, or, in a tournament, if the big blind busts out. Here is how it works in a nontournament situation: If the player in this position leaves for some reason — one good reason being that that player goes broke — a player to his left might end up not putting in the correct amount for having had all the blinds. To avoid this, many cardrooms have a&nbsp;<em>dead button rule</em>. The way it works in practice is if the next player to have the button is not present, but was there for the previous hand, the house dealer places the button at the empty position, and starts dealing to the player to the left of that position, just as if a player actually were in the empty seat. The button position does not receive any cards on that deal. Some cardrooms handle the situation by moving the button and having players with blinds put extra chips in such that the total they put in on the round is the same as if they had sat through all the blinds; this is not considered an implementation of the dead button rule, but is referred to as making up the blinds (see&nbsp;make up the blinds). Other cardrooms move the button and allow players in blind positions to put in just the blinds indicated by their position, which essentially means that they “get lucky” and don’t have to put in the full blind complement. (The latter is the usual online implementation.) Here is how it works in a tournament: If a player is eliminated while in the big blind, on the next hand, the player to the left of the empty seat puts up a single big blind. There is no small blind on that hand. For the next hand, the button moves into the empty seat, and the player to the left of the empty seat puts up the small blind. If a player is eliminated while in the small blind, the button moves into the empty seat for the next hand. This rule ensures that the remaining players put up the blinds that they would normally put up if the eliminated player were still at the table. With this rule, no one skips a blind or plays the same blind twice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> The two-pair hand aces and 8s. Supposedly James Butler (“Wild Bill”) Hickok, a noted gunfighter, scout, and gambler of the American Old West, was holding aces and 8s when he was shot in the back by Jack McCall in the No. 10 Saloon in Deadwood, South Dakota, on August 2, 1876. (It was also known as the Mann-Lewis Saloon, after its owners. The No. 10 name had to do with a mining claim.) There is some controversy as to the fifth card. Some say all the cards in the hand were black, and that the fifth card was the jack of spades. The current story promulgated by the cardrooms of Deadwood is that the two pair were black and the fifth card was the nine of diamonds. Even so, the term&nbsp;<em>dead man’s hand</em> usually just refers to two pair, aces and 8s, in any combination.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> In hold’em, A-8 as starting cards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Distribute the cards to the players.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Arrange to redistribute tournament winnings in some manner not according to the announced disposition. For example, when there are three players left, they may agree to allocate prize money based on stack sizes.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Split (definition 4).&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> Agree to apportion some part of a pot before the final outcome. This is often done in hold’em when one player is all in and either the river or the turn and river have not been dealt. For example, one player might have top pair while the other has a flush draw and no overcards, and the two might agree for each of them to take back some part of the final bet. With two cards to come, the flush would be made approximately one-third of the time, so the players might agree that of the last $900 bet, the player with the pair would remove $600 and the player with the draw $300. In such a case, one player might say to the other, “Do you want to deal?” They would then negotiate terms.&nbsp;<strong>— </strong>&nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> The act of dealing. “He got a full house on the deal.” “Whose deal is it?”&nbsp;<strong>6.</strong> The dealing position. “Where is the deal?” means “Where is the dealing position?,” and it implies “Whose deal is it?” You might hear, “I sat down to the right of the deal and posted.”&nbsp;<strong>7.</strong> Split (definition 2).&nbsp;<strong>8.</strong> Save (definition 3).&nbsp;<strong>9.</strong> An agreement to redistribute tournament winnings in some manner not according to the announced disposition.

<a name='name.D041'>&nbsp;</a><h2>dealer advantage</h2>
<p>In a draw poker game, before the draw, the dealer gets information in many ways. He gets information about how everyone bets before it is his turn to act. He gets information at the time of the draw about how many cards they take. And, again, after the draw, he gets information about how they bet. In hold’em-type games in which the betting each round after the first proceeds from the dealer’s left and around, the dealer finds out how each player acts on his hand before himself having to act. This positional edge in both games is called&nbsp;<em>dealer advantage</em>. Dealer advantage does not exist in stud games, in which the first to act on each round is usually the holder of the high board.

<a name='name.D082'>&nbsp;</a><h2>declaration</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Verbal showdown. If prior to showing your cards you say, “I have a full house,” that statement is a&nbsp;<em>declaration</em>.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> In a&nbsp;high-low split game, using chips or voice to indicate whether you’re going for high, low, or both. Such a declaration is usually done after all the betting is over, and is either&nbsp;<em>consecutive</em> or<em>sequential</em>. (See&nbsp;consecutive declaration,&nbsp;sequential declaration.) This is not common in public cardrooms, where high-low split games are usually played in what is called&nbsp;cards speak.</p>

<a name='name.D084'>&nbsp;</a><h2>deep</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Pertaining to how many chips one has. In a no-limit game, while contemplating a bet into or a bet from another, a player might ask, “How deep are you?,” meaning, “How much money do you have on the table?” Such a question might be asked because the player of whom it is asked might have chips of mixed denominations, jumbled stacks, or bundles of uncounted bills.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Having a lot of chips. “Phil is deep, so the other players are staying away from him.”&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> With respect to a potential bet, large compared to the player’s total stack. While observing an opponent in a&nbsp;big bet game trying to make up his mind how much to bet, a player might say, “You’re reaching awfully deep there.”&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> With respect to investment in a specific game, considerable. “I’m pretty deep in this game.”&nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> With respect to a tournament, having outlasted most of one’s opponents. “Michael finished deep in the main event.”&nbsp;<strong>6.</strong> With respect to a lowball hand, the rank of the top card of the hand one is trying to make when that card is lower than another draw one could make. For example, in ace-to-five, Matt stands pat, after having bet all his chips before the draw. In&nbsp;ace-to-five lowball, Susie has <q class='s'>K</q><q class='h'>8</q><q class='d'>7</q><q class='s'>2</q> joker. She is afraid Matt has better than a pat 8-7, so she asks for two cards. At the showdown, Matt spreads a 9-8, and Susie says, “Oh dear; I drew too deep. The first card I caught was an ace.” That is, she could have won by drawing one card to her 8-7.</p>

<a name='name.D094'>&nbsp;</a><h2>defensive play</h2>
<p>Not allowing oneself to be&nbsp;run over by an aggressive player, particularly when one has the big blind. For example, if the player to your right always comes in for a raise when no one else opens, that player has to be opening with a lot of substandard hands. To try to stop this blind stealing, you have to play hands yourself that you would ordinarily throw away for a raise, and sometimes reraise with those hands. This is not necessarily as the situation described under&nbsp;defend the blind, because if the player to your right is selective in his aggression, you cannot call every time.</p>

<a name='name.D190'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Double Cross Poker</h2>
<p>A house-banked casino game dealt from one deck, in which players play separately against the dealer. The game is related to&nbsp;hold’em in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. Each player makes an initial ante wager, plus an optional three-card side bet. The dealer gives each player and himself two downcards. The dealer deals five community cards face down in the shape of a cross, three cards across and three cards down, with the middle card shared by both arms of the cross. The dealer exposes the bottom card as seen by the players. Each player who has made the three-card side bet then forms a three-card hand of his two cards and that one exposed community card and wins for a pair or better, according to the following: one pair, 1:1; flush, 4:1; straight, 6:1; three of a kind, 30:1; straight flush, 40:1. The dealer pays those who made and won the three-card side bet, and collects from those bets that lost. The dealer then exposes the leftmost card as seen by the players. Each player decides which arm, based on viewing of the now two exposed cards, to play his eventual five-card hand, horizontal or vertical, and must either fold and lose the ante or make a raise bet equal to twice the size of the ante, placed in the appropriate box (horizontal or vertical). After all players have made their decisions, the dealer exposes the remaining community cards, and uses whichever arm of the cross, horizontal or vertical, that gives him the best five-card poker hand. The dealer then compares his hand to the chosen hand of each player remaining in the game. If the player loses, as determined by the five-card hand formed from the player’s two cards plus the three from the arm he chose, the dealer collects the ante and raise; a tie is a push. If the player wins, he gets paid 1:1 on the ante plus he wins according to the following (paid as a multiple of the raised bet): royal flush, 300:1; straight flush, 50:1; four of a kind, 15:1; full house, 7:1; flush, 6:1; straight, 5:1; three of a kind, 3:1; two pair, 3:2; any lesser hand, 1:1.</p>

<a name='name.D191'>&nbsp;</a><h2>double-dealing</h2>
<p>A cheating move in which a dealer gives more cards (usually two at a time rather than one) to his confederate or himself than to the other players.

<a name='name.D229'>&nbsp;</a><h2>down the river</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Seven-card stud.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> The final card in seven-card stud. The term may have come from “sold down the river,” which had been the fate of unruly slaves in the border states — they were sold to plantations farther south, where working conditions were even harsher. Unlike&nbsp;five-card stud, the last card was delivered face down, likely giving rise to a nickname with “down” in it while at the same time connoting a cruel betrayal by fate. The term “river” also had echoes of where poker flourished early, the Mississippi River. Since the origins of many poker terms are lost in antiquity, this derivation cannot be documented.</p>

<a name='name.D230'>&nbsp;</a><h2>down the road</h2>
<p>At another club (which could be a considerable distance away and not necessarily even on the same street). This term is used, rather than naming the establishment, because it’s considered bad form to talk about a club other than the one in which you’re playing. “How’d you make out down the road?” means “How did you fare at the club whose name you and I both know that the other is referring to but that we do not want to say out loud for fear of distressing the present management and because to do so would not be good manners?” Also,&nbsp;<em>down there</em>,&nbsp;<em>down the street</em>.</p>

<a name='name.D283'>&nbsp;</a><h2>dry pot</h2>
<p>A side pot about to be created by the current bet that cannot be won by the player making the bet if anyone calls, in a situation in which that player also cannot possibly win the main pot.&nbsp;<em>Betting into a dry pot</em> is presumably a wasted (and stupid) gesture because the best the bettor can do is take his money back out of the pot, but it may have its strategic value in changing the winner of the pot. (This is not the same as the situation in which someone makes a bet when there is a side pot that cannot win&nbsp;<em>if called</em>. However, if it gets everyone to fold except for someone who is all in for the main pot, the bettor can win the main pot because the all-in player might not necessarily be able to beat the hand of the bettor.) For example, one player is all in, in a three-way pot. The bettor knows he himself cannot win, but he makes a large bet anyway, because he thinks that if there is just a showdown, the third player will get the pot — perhaps because he has already seen the all-in player’s hand, or perhaps because he has figured out what it is, but in any case that particular hand does not have much of a chance of winning without the&nbsp;protection bet and he does not want the third player to win it. The third player throws away his cards, thinking that the bettor could not be betting on nothing and that he will get to see the hand anyway (it’s a&nbsp;called hand — that is, one that must be shown at the end — because one player is all in). When he does see the cards that could not possibly win either the side or main pot, the third player angrily exclaims, “How could you bet into a&nbsp;<em>dry pot</em>?” An example with specific cards makes this clearer. Matt has $40 in a no-limit hold’em game. Brianne has $160 and Andy has $200. Matt opens for the minimum, $5. Brianne calls. Andy raises to $40. Matt and Brianne both call. There is no betting till the river. The board reads <q class='s'>A</q><q class='s'>9</q><q class='d'>5</q><q class='d'>J</q><q class='d'>Q</q>. Matt is all in, so cannot bet. Brianne checks, but does it in such a way that Andy, who has a&nbsp;tell on Brianne, thinks that Brianne probably has a pair smaller than 9s. Andy bets the rest of his chips on the side. Brianne thinks to herself,&nbsp;<em>One of them likely has me beat, so it would be stupid to throw away another $120. Anyway, I’ll get to see both hands for free.</em> When Brianne folds, Andy withdraws the chips he had bet, since Matt had no chips left with which to call, and Brianne folded. Matt now says, “You must have me; I just have a pair of 3s.” “No, no, you win,” says Andy; “I have deuces.” “Damn!” says Brianne; “I had the best hand. That shoulda been my pot. What the hell are you doing betting into a dry pot?” Andy does not respond, but he has accomplished two things. One is that Matt now has $120, and Matt is much easier to beat than Brianne. Another is that Brianne is now angry at Andy, and when one player is angry at another, it can make her play poorly against that player.</p>

<a name='name.D297'>&nbsp;</a><h2>duplicate poker</h2>
<p>A poker analog of duplicate bridge, often played in a tournament format, with players, usually on teams, playing the same prearranged hands. There are several competing formats, but in general each table position gets the same hand as the same corresponding position on each other table, and scoring is usually based on how much a player nets compared to opposing members. Thus, a player who loses the least on a specific hand that&nbsp;<em>everyone</em> loses would be the “winner” of that contest, while, similarly, the one who wins the most on a given hand would get the most points.</p>
