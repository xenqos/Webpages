<a name='name.F006'>&nbsp;</a><h2>face-up</h2>
<p>Describing cards&nbsp;face up. “Players get four face-up cards.”</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.F007'>&nbsp;</a><h2>factory defect</h2>
<p>An irregularity in one or more cards, such as misprinted or flawed cards or other unintentional markings, which could permit observant players to identify some (or, rarely, all) of the cards from the back. Also see&nbsp;honest reader,&nbsp;imperfect deck.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.F008'>&nbsp;</a><h2>“Factory defect!”</h2>
<p>&nbsp;“New deck.” Call made by a player or dealer when a deck with a&nbsp;factory defect is found in a game, that is, a deck that must be immediately replaced. The request is sometimes facetiously uttered right after a disgruntled player has crumpled or torn up one or more cards (or an entire deck) after a bad beat or receiving an unwanted card on the draw.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.F014'>&nbsp;</a><h2>false openers</h2>
<p>A hand that was opened without having opening requirements. For example, in&nbsp;jacks or better, the opener must already have in his hand at least a pair of jacks. Someone in next-to-last position in an unopened pot might have four cards to a straight flush and dearly like to open the pot. If he does, he is said to have&nbsp;<em>false openers</em>. Usually the opener of a pot in such a game has to&nbsp;show openers. If he cannot prove he had openers, the player cannot win the pot.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.F015'>&nbsp;</a><h2>false shuffle</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> An appearance of shuffling the cards by a cheat, but without actually changing their order (from a presumably set-up arrangement), by pulling one half of the pack through the other half, and then replacing the deck to its original position. — &nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Give the deck such a shuffle.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.F016'>&nbsp;</a><h2>false tell</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> A&nbsp;tell that gives the opposite impression from what is expected. For example, if you see an opponent act in a certain way every time he’s bluffing, and you make a large call when he does it one more time, only this time he’s got the nuts, you’ve been taken in by a&nbsp;<em>false tell</em>. He might rub his eye in a certain way, interlace his fingers under his chin and lean his chin on them, or exhibit some other mannerism that appears to be unconscious, but actually was done deliberately to set you up. (The poker game in the 2006 version of&nbsp;<em>Casino Royale</em> features a false tell.)

<a name='name.F146'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Flop Poker</h2>
<p>A house-banked card game that uses poker hand rankings, in which players do not compete against the dealer. The game is related to&nbsp;hold’em in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. The object of the game is to make a poker hand containing a pair of jacks or better using the player’s three cards dealt and the three community cards turned up by the dealer. In addition, players can bet that their hand will be the best of all hands dealt. Each player places two bets, an&nbsp;<em>ante</em> bet and a&nbsp;<em>pot</em> bet. The ante wager can be any amount up to the table limit. The pot bet is always the table minimum. Three cards are dealt to each player face down. The player may look at his own cards but sharing of information is not allowed. The player has two options, raise or fold. If the player folds, he forfeits his ante but retains his cards for later settling of the pot bet. If the player raises, he does so by making a&nbsp;<em>flop</em> bet equal to his ante bet. The dealer then deals a three-card flop face up. These are community cards and are used by all players. The dealer determines in turn each player’s best poker hand using all three of the player cards in combination with any two of the flop cards. If the player has at least a pair of jacks, the ante wager pays even money and the flop wager pays all winners according to a pay table, ranging from even money on a pair of jacks or better to 1,000:1 for a royal flush. Finally, the player with the highest poker hand, again using his own three cards and any two flop cards, wins all pot bets. If two or more hands are tied, the pot bets are split among the players holding those hands. Like the odds bet of craps, the&nbsp;<em>pot</em> bet of Flop Poker has absolutely no house advantage. That is, it pays&nbsp;correct odds (definition 1).</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Five cards of the same suit, not in sequence. In high poker, this hand ranks above a&nbsp;straight and below a&nbsp;full house.

Five cards of the same suit in sequence constitutes a hand known as a&nbsp;straight flush. Unlike the game of bridge, suits do not count; two flushes with all five cards duplicated would split the pot at the showdown. That is, <q class='h'>A</q><q class='h'>K</q><q class='h'>9</q><q class='h'>4</q><q class='h'>2</q> ranks the same as the preceding.

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> A mandatory bet on the first round of play in a stud game. For example, in seven-card stud, the lowest card dealt on the first round might have to make a&nbsp;<em>forced bet</em>, usually of a smaller amount than the normal betting limit. In a $2-$4 game, the lowest card might have to bet 50 cents. Subsequent bettors may either call, or raise by $2 (sometimes only to $2, that is, a raise of $1.50). In most home games, the forced bet is made by the highest exposed card in high games, and by the lowest exposed card in low games. If two cards of the same rank appear, the one closest to the left of the dealer must make the forced bet. In cardrooms,&nbsp;bridge order (or&nbsp;reverse bridge order) is sometimes used.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> A requirement, generally found only in home games, that the first player with&nbsp;action (definition 2), usually the player to the left of the dealer, or, in a game with blinds, to the left of the big blind, must come into the pot, that is, cannot fold.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Any bet that must be made prior to the deal of a hand, such as an ante or blind.</p>

<a name='name.F192'>&nbsp;</a><h2>four-card poker</h2>
<p>A house-banked game, which resembles poker only in the ranking of the hands, dealt from one deck, similar to&nbsp;three-card poker. Each player receives five cards from which to make four-card poker hands (with four-card straights and four-card flushes as ranking hands, and hands ranked thus: four of a kind, straight flush, three of a kind, flush, straight, two pair, pair); only the best four cards in each hand are used to determine winners. The dealer gets six cards to make a four-card hand; one of the dealer’s cards is dealt face up. Two bets can be made. For the original bet (the ante), a player is paid, if he stays, on certain holdings according to a pay scale, ranging from 2:1 for three of a kind to 25:1 for four of a kind. After seeing his hand, a player can either fold or stay in the game by making a second bet (the Aces Up bet), and then his hand competes against the dealer’s; the player wins ties. This second bet can be equal to, twice, or three times the ante. If the player does not make the Aces Up bet, he loses the original bet. Unlike three-card poker, the dealer does not need to qualify. Some casinos have other rules, sometimes involving three bets. The Aces Up bet wins when the player has a pair of aces or better, ranging from even money for a pair of aces to 50:1 for four of a kind. The game was invented by Shuffle Master, a company that makes automatic card-shuffling machines for casinos and cardrooms and devises new casino games.</p>

An early player bets, and there are a few calls. You raise, and all call. No matter the turn card, the other players may check to you.

(I say “presumably” because some players seem to have a free look every hand, and yet they always look at the first four dealt them in the order dealt.) You might in lowball hear a player say, “I’ve got a free look, and I’m gonna raise it.” That gives others the impression that the player has raised without seeing the fifth card, but hardly anyone ever believes that.</p>

By extension to draw, this would be the situation in a double-limit blind game with a&nbsp;gypsy (permitting players to open for a bet equal to the size of the blind) in which players opened for the minimum and the blind gets to draw without putting any extra money in the pot.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> In&nbsp;pass-and-back-in draw poker, an opening round in which no one opens, thus allowing every player to draw without having to make a bet.</p>

<a name='name.F235'>&nbsp;</a><h2>French deck</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;deck of cards used by the French, who have been designing and manufacturing playing cards since at least the 15th Century, when they assigned to each of the court cards names taken from history or mythology. These designs appear often somewhat different in design in the&nbsp;<em>English deck</em>. In the French deck, the face cards had specific meaning, whereas in the English deck, card historians generally accept that they do not. Confusion lies in the fact that the suits in the English deck came from the French deck.</p>

<a name='name.F252'>&nbsp;</a><h2>full bet</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> In a limit game, a bet as large as the current limit. For example, in a $10-$20 game, in the $10 round or rounds, $10 is a full bet, and anything less is not. Cardrooms have different interpretations as to whether anything less than a full bet can be raised or whether a player is even permitted to bet less, and if an&nbsp;all-in player bets less, whether succeeding players can call that amount or must themselves put in a full bet.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> In a no-limit, pot-limit, or spread-limit game, a bet as large as the minimum for the table, with similar discussion as the preceding.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> In a no-limit, pot-limit, or spread-limit game, a bet as large as the preceding bet. For example, if Emilie bets $50 and John can call only $30 of that, he would be said not to have a full bet. In this sense, the term&nbsp;short or&nbsp;<em>short bet</em> is often used. For definitions 1 and 2, also see&nbsp;complete the bet,&nbsp;half a bet,&nbsp;legal raise. In some cardrooms, a raise of half a bet is considered to&nbsp;reopen the betting; in others, only a full bet does so. The rule covering all of these situations is known as the&nbsp;<em>full-bet rule</em>.</p>
