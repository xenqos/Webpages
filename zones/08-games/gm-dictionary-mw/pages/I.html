This term is frequently found in poker literature, particularly that of years gone by, but is not at all common in cardrooms.

<a name='name.I024'>&nbsp;</a><h2>implicit collusion</h2>
<p>A situation can arise in which the leader in a pot would prefer that one or more of his opponents fold because, while he has a positive expectation on his bet, he is not a favorite against the field. In&nbsp;<em>implicit collusion</em>, all opponents come to an independent agreement — that is, without consulting among each other — to all play in such a way as to minimize the chance of the player with the best hand winning the pot. For example, in a hold’em tournament, a small stack may go all in and get called by one or more players with larger stacks. Those players collectively have a better chance of beating the all-in player than any does individually, and they may check down the hand till the end, that is, with no one making a bet that might drive anyone else out. The all-in player may have the best hand and be the favorite against any one of the others, but collectively, the remaining players have a better chance against the all-in player, and if they all understand — even though nothing is ever said to that effect — that all will check the hand down, that is&nbsp;<em>implicit collusion</em>. In another example, a bluff may have a high chance of success against any one opponent, but against multiple opponents have no chance at all. In low-limit games, with their many players remaining at the end, a bluff against the field has almost no chance of succeeding. Again, this involves&nbsp;<em>implicit collusion</em> among the players. They may not be aware of the situation, but it does exist. Similar situations arise in other games.</p>

<a name='name.I025'>&nbsp;</a><h2>implied odds</h2>

<a name='name.I028'>&nbsp;</a><h2>improve</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Better a hand, particularly catch one needed card. For example, in draw poker, you call an all-in raise from another player to draw one card to two pair.

You show that you made a full house, with the comment, “I improved.” Also,&nbsp;<em>help</em>.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Have a specific hand made in a stud or hold’em-type game, and then, upon the appearance of another card, make a better hand. For example, your first five cards in seven-stud are <q class='s'>T</q><q class='s'>9</q><q class='s'>3</q><q class='s'>J</q><q class='s'>5</q>, giving you a jack-high flush. Your next card is <q class='s'>A</q>, causing you to&nbsp;<em>improve</em> (to an ace-high flush).</p>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.I035'>&nbsp;</a><h2>index</h2>
<p>A variant of poker, usually played only in home games, in which players can see all hands except their own, and bet based on other players’ reactions to their and other hands. In all cases, each player holds one or more cards to his forehead, facing outward, with the tacit understanding that no player has “peeked” at his own card or cards. In the simplest form, one card is used and high card wins at whatever point the betting is equalized. Anywhere from two to five cards can also be used, with appropriate hand rankings. In one version, which has become an unofficial event at the&nbsp;World Series of Poker, players start with two cards on their foreheads and then play&nbsp;hold’em, with a flop, turn, and river dealt to the table just as in the usual form of the game. The name comes from the positioning of feathers in a headdress. Sometimes called&nbsp;<em>blind man’s bluff</em>.</p>

<a name='name.I054'>&nbsp;</a><h2>insurance</h2>
<p>A side bet between two players, or between one player and an outsider (often known as an&nbsp;<em>insurance man</em>) who makes a business of this sort of thing, against a particular hand losing, usually made at a point before the fall of the final card or cards. For example, in a no-limit hold’em game, one player is all in on fourth street for his entire bankroll. If he loses, he has to leave this wonderful game, and probably go back to playing small limit. He has pocket aces, with another ace on the board. There are also two spades on the board, and his opponent has turned up his two spades in the hole. Our hero can lose only if a spade comes on the end that does not pair one of the other cards on the board. The odds against this can be worked out. The holder of the pair of aces can contract for&nbsp;<em>insurance</em>. If he loses the pot, the person with whom he arranged the insurance pays him some amount, usually equal to the value of the pot; if he wins, he pays that person some amount that, based on the odds against his losing, allows that person to make a profit (that is, have a&nbsp;positive expectation over the long run). The more desperate the person who makes the&nbsp;<em>insurance bet</em>, the worse the terms exacted by the seller of the insurance.</p>

<p>A set of signals supposedly universally recognized by all thieves, allowing thieves who don’t even know each other to communicate their desire to fleece the suckers, indicate their need for particular cards, and so on.

Some thieves still are not clever enough to understand these concepts, however, and you may see the signals (see&nbsp;signal) in some games, particularly those in which the management does not give its players much&nbsp;protection.</p>
