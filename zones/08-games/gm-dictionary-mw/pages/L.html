<p>A form of&nbsp;widow game, a variant of&nbsp;Cincinnati, found only in home games, in which each player is dealt five downcards, as in draw, followed by a betting round, and then five cards are turned face up one at a time, with each followed by another betting round, the difference from Cincinnati being that the lowest card in the widow and any others of the same rank are wild. Each player makes the best hand possible by using any combination from his five and the five in the middle.</p>

<a name='name.L014'>&nbsp;</a><h2>lammer</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> A special chip given to the winner of a&nbsp;satellite tournament, to be used as a complete or partial entry or buy-in to a larger tournament. The chip can be used&nbsp;<em>only</em> to buy in to a tournament, but can be sold to another player for this purpose. For example, a&nbsp;supersatellite at the World Series of Poker might award three lammers each worth $500. The winner might use those three lammers to buy in to a $1,500 tournament, or collect two more and use them for a $2,500 tournament. The term originally came from the chip-shaped markers used in other table games, such as craps, where they might indicate, for example, “on” or “off.” The name probably came from these chips being made of laminated plastic.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> The marker chip that a chip runner (or other floorperson) leaves in the tray of a house dealer at a poker table when taking cash out of the dealer’s tray, for which the runner will return with a corresponding amount of chips.</p>

<a name='name.L022'>&nbsp;</a><h2>last bet</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> A betting scheme, used only in home games, in which the betting on one round begins with the player who initiated the betting on the previous round (if there was no raise), or with the player who put in the last raise that was called around. In stud games, the actual boards of the players have no relevance. If there was no betting on the previous round, then it goes back to the last bet of the round before. For example, in a stud game, after the first upcard, John, under the gun, makes the forced high-card bet, showing an ace. Two players call, and Andy raises, showing a queen. One player calls behind, as do John and the other two players. On the next card, John has A-K and Andy has Q-J. Andy, having put in the last raise, bets first. All call. Andy is again first on the next round.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> In a hand featuring betting with multiple raises, the last raise on a particular round. “The live one put in the last bet every round and caught runner-runner spades.” This means that the player in question raised every round, perhaps putting in the third or fourth bet.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.L023'>&nbsp;</a><h2>last card</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>bottom card</em> in a shuffled deck, which would be the final card to be dealt if all the cards were dealt out. In some draw games, the last card remaining in the&nbsp;stub cannot be dealt on the draw. The&nbsp;penultimate card is dealt, and then all discards and the last card are shuffled and the remaining draw cards dealt from those cards. (Sometimes the cards of the person about to receive cards are not shuffled in so that the player cannot receive his own discards on the draw.)</p>

<a name='name.L069'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Let It Ride Bonus</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;nonpoker game, banked by the house, that resembles poker only in the ranking of the hands. The game looks like a combination of five-card stud and hold’em. The game is played on a seven-seat table, similar to a blackjack table. The object of the game is to make a poker hand containing a pair of 10s or better using the player’s three cards dealt and two community cards turned up by the dealer. Each player places three equal bets in circles marked 1, 2, and $. Three cards are dealt to each player. If the player likes his cards, he “lets it ride.” If he doesn’t like them, he requests the first bet back. Whatever the player’s decision, then the dealer turns over one of the two community cards. If the player still likes his cards, he can again “let it ride” or request back his second bet. Finally, the dealer turns over the second community card and pays all winners according to a pay table, ranging from even money on a pair of 10s or better to 1,000:1 for a royal flush. A player can also make an extra side bet, with certain bonus hands paying large payouts, sometimes including part or all of a progressive jackpot. The game was invented by Shuffle Master, a company that makes automatic card-shuffling machines for casinos and cardrooms and devises new casino games. The game was formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Let It Ride!</em> (including the exclamation point); some casinos still use that name.</p>

<a name='name.L078'>&nbsp;</a><h2>lights</h2>
<p>In a home game, a situation that comes up when a player is&nbsp;light (definition 1). In some home games, not played for&nbsp;table stakes, when a player does not have enough chips to continue betting in a pot, that player withdraws chips from the pot equal to the amount of the betting beyond his chips, (usually) stacking them neatly in front of him. These are called&nbsp;<em>lights</em>. (To withdraw chips in this manner is called&nbsp;<em>go light</em>.) At the end of the hand, if the player does not win the pot, he buys enough chips to cover his lights. He then&nbsp;<em>matches his lights</em>, that is, puts the lights into the pot plus an equivalent amount of chips from the ones he has just bought. For example, in a stud game, Jill starts with $16. After the sixth card, she has $2 left. The high hand bets $4. She puts her last $2 in the pot, and pulls $2 from the pot, and stacks it in front of her. At this point, she might say, “I’m light,” or, “I’m going light.” On the last round, someone bets $4 and someone calls. She pulls another $4 from the pot, adding it to her pile of lights. On the showdown, she finds that her three 7s are beat by a small straight. She buys another $50 worth of chips from the banker, adds $6 to her lights, and puts the $12 in the pot. At this point, the winner takes the whole pot. In a split (two-way) pot, if either the winner of the high half or the winner of the low half has lights, or both do, they&nbsp;<em>exchange lights</em> and then split the pot. This is equivalent to each first matching lights, and then splitting the pot, and saves time.</p>

Also called&nbsp;<em>betting limit</em>.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Limit poker. “I prefer limit to no-limit.”&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> “The limit” is an expression used by draw poker players at the time of the draw referring to how many cards they wish.

<a name='name.L082'>&nbsp;</a><h2>limit poker</h2>
<p>A form of poker in which all bets are in increments of the&nbsp;<em>betting limit</em>, which is usually at one level in early rounds of betting and twice that level in the remaining rounds. For example, in a $2-$4 game, players can bet or raise only $2 at a time on the first rounds, and, similarly, only $4 at a time on later rounds. Limit poker is often called&nbsp;structured limit, and the most common variety is&nbsp;double limit, in which the betting increments double after the draw. In&nbsp;single limit (also known as&nbsp;<em>straight limit</em>),&nbsp;<em>all</em> bets are in multiples of the limit. In&nbsp;double limit, the size of the game is usually expressed as two numbers, as, variously, 3/6, 3-6, $3/$6, $3-$6, 5/10, and so on, while in single-limit, one number, as $2-limit (which game is also called the&nbsp;<em>two-limit</em>, the&nbsp;<em>two</em>, or the&nbsp;<em>deuce</em>) or $80-limit.</p>

<a name='name.L121'>&nbsp;</a><h2>live bet</h2>
<p>A bet posted by a player under conditions that give the player the option of raising even if no other player raises first; typically because it was posted as a blind (see&nbsp;live blind), as a&nbsp;straddle, to enter a new game (see&nbsp;post), or as a&nbsp;reentry blind).</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.L122'>&nbsp;</a><h2>live blind</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> In a&nbsp;structured-limit game, including almost any&nbsp;flop game and some lowball games, a blind that can be raised even when the opening bet is not a raise. For example, in a $3-$6 hold’em game, the player to the dealer’s left puts $3 in the pot before receiving his cards and the player to his left puts in $6. The first player to open&nbsp;<em>often</em> opens for $12, that is, by raising, but not always. In a&nbsp;<em>live blind</em> game, if the pot is opened for $6 (see&nbsp;limp) and no one raises, when the action returns to the big blind, he has the&nbsp;option of raising, or just calling and closing the action (see&nbsp;close the action).&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> A blind a player gets to keep when he wins a pot, because the next pot will be blinded by someone other than the winner of the present pot. Examples of&nbsp;<em>live blinds</em> are those in a&nbsp;traveling blind game, or those in a game in which each player must blind the pot at least once within a specified period of time. Compare with&nbsp;dead blind.</p>

When the action gets to the button, he can get in the pot for $3 less, because he already is considered to have contributed $3 to the pot, and the $3plays for the button.</p>

<a name='name.L167'>&nbsp;</a><h2>look</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Call, especially the final bet or raise before the showdown; often followed by&nbsp;<em>at</em>. If someone bets at you and you say, “I’ll look,” that means, “I’ll call you.” “I’ll look at you” means the same. In most cardrooms, saying “I’ll look” is&nbsp;<em>not</em> equivalent to saying “I call.” The latter is usually binding, that is, if you say “I call” when it is your turn to act, you must put chips in the pot, even if the other player shows his cards before you have a chance to physically get them in. (It’s usually a good idea, however, unless you know the other player very well, to wait until the chips are actually in the pot before showing your cards, even in establishments in which verbal declarations are binding. Saves arguments later.) “I’ll look” is generally a phrase said accompanying the actual act of placing the calling chips in the pot, and is generally not binding (although it could be interpreted that way: another reason to be careful of what you say in turn). In this sense,&nbsp;see [<em>the</em> or&nbsp;<em>your bet</em>] is also frequently used. — &nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Part of the phrase&nbsp;free look.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Part of the phrase&nbsp;look [someone] up.</p>

In lowball, implies taking all the one-card draws to&nbsp;rough hands (that is hands that frequently lose even when they are made perfectly), and most of the two-card draws. You often hear the rhyming phrase&nbsp;<em>loose as a goose</em> or&nbsp;<em>loosey-goosey</em>.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> More generally, playing liberally, though not necessarily as liberally as in the preceding.</p>
