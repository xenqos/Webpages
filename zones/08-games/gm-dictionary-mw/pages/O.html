<a name='name.O106'>&nbsp;</a><h2>on the come</h2>
<p>Describing a bet made on or the situation of an unmade hand before all the cards have been dealt, or in the anticipation of making a hand. In high (draw, stud, or hold’em), this is usually four cards to a straight, flush, or straight flush; in lowball, it is usually whatever you’re drawing to, that is, implying a draw as opposed to a&nbsp;complete hand. To&nbsp;<em>raise on the come</em> means to start with four cards to a good hand that is not yet made, and raise the pot before the turn (or the draw) to build a larger pot, with the hope of making the hand and having a larger pot to bet into on the turn or river (or after the draw). To&nbsp;<em>bet on the come</em> usually means to bet as just described; sometimes to make a blind bet after the draw after having drawn one card to a&nbsp;come hand. (A&nbsp;<em>come hand</em> is a hand that needs one card&nbsp;<em>on the come</em>.) In hold’em, a player with two spades in the hole and two on the flop who bets or raises is doing so&nbsp;<em>on the come</em>. Similarly, a player who starts with A-2-3-4-K in&nbsp;ace-to-five lowball and raises is&nbsp;<em>raising on the come</em>. Also see&nbsp;semibluff.</p>

<a name='name.O168'>&nbsp;</a><h2>optimal bluffing frequency</h2>
<p>Bluffing in such a way that observant opponents cannot gain an advantage from their calling frequency. “Mathematically, the optimal bluffing strategy is to bluff in such a way that the chances against your bluffing are identical to the pot odds your opponent is getting.” (David Sklansky,&nbsp;<em>The Theory of Poker</em>.) The mathematically optimal bluffing strategy isn’t necessarily the best strategy; much better is the ability to judge when to try a bluff and when not to to show a larger overall profit. That is, bluff more often against timid players and less often against calling stations and those who think you bluff too much. Optimal bluffing frequency works best (most optimally) against players whose calling frequencies you do not know. See discussion at&nbsp;game theory.</p>

For example, if a pot contains $500 at a particular stage, no more than $500 can be bet at that point; any bet greater than that amount is an&nbsp;<em>overbet</em>.

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Put in a blind when one is already present. In a&nbsp;traveling blind game, this could mean someone putting in an optional blind in addition to the mandatory blinds.

Sometimes called&nbsp;<em>go the overs</em>. — &nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> The blind put in by the person who&nbsp;<em>overblinds</em>. In a 1-1-2 traveling blind draw game (Northern California-style, with limit bets of $4 or $4 minimum bet no-limit), John might put in $4 before getting his cards. He has doubled the limit (or the minimum bet) to $4, and he gets last action before the draw.

The reason for the rule is that one of the tactics of an&nbsp;angle shooter is to miscall a hand hoping that the other player will inadvertently throw away the winning hand. If the loser then sees that the hand did not really have, for example, a flush, but only four hearts and a diamond, the&nbsp;<em>angler</em> then says, “Oh, sorry; I overlooked my hand. Thought I had a flush.” — &nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> The act of so (definition 1) calling. “Wouldn’t you know that when I was bluffing, not only did Curly call me, but I got two overcalls!”</p>
