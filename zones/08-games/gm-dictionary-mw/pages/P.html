<a name='name.P011'>&nbsp;</a><h2>pai gow poker</h2>
<p>A banking game based on the Asian tile game pai gow (also known as pai gow tiles). In the tiles version, players arrange groups of four tiles into two hands of two tiles each, which then compete one at a time against the two hands played by the banker. In the card version, each player makes a wager, and then receives seven cards, which he arranges into two hands, one consisting of five cards and one of two, with the stipulation that the five-card hand must rank higher than the two-card hand. These hands, after being&nbsp;<em>set</em> (arranged), are placed in front of the player, and then compete, one at a time, as in a blackjack game, against the banker hand (which can be held by a player — called the&nbsp;<em>player dealer </em>or<em> player banker </em>— or the house). If both player hands beat the dealer hand, the player wins; if both banker hands beat the player hand, the dealer wins; otherwise it is a push. If either hand is exactly the same , that counts as a win for the banker, which gives the banker hand a slight edge. The banker hand settles wagers against player hands in an order determined by the shaking of a number of dice; the first hand to settle is designated with an&nbsp;<em>action button</em>. (This shaking of the dice gives the game its alternative name of&nbsp;<em>shake-shake</em>.) This order is important, because if the banker loses his stake prematurely, not all player hands may get to compete. The house makes its money by always extracting a certain fee from every player bet, prior to the actual playing of the hands (and often takes that fee whether or not the hand is even played). Apart from the rankings of the hands being the same as in poker, pai gow poker is not really poker. Also called&nbsp;<em>double hand</em> or&nbsp;<em>double-hand poker</em>.</p>

<a name='name.P051'>&nbsp;</a><h2>pass for a prop</h2>
<p>In a no-limit lowball game, when a player is faced with a raise, and wants to gamble alone with the raiser, usually involving a&nbsp;proposition like&nbsp;two-for-one, but there are other players to act after the player, in some clubs the player is permitted to&nbsp;<em>pass for a prop</em>, and then, if the other players do not call the bet, can negotiate a proposition with the raiser. If any other player calls the bet, usually the player who so passed is required to drop; furthermore, if the raiser does not wish to accept the proposition, the passer must also drop. For example, in a $4-to-go no-limit&nbsp;ace-to-five lowball game, Harry opens with A-joker-2-K-K. Kate and Bob call. Walt raises $35. Harry does not fold, nor does he call the raise. Instead he says, “Pass for a prop.” Kate and Bob now both fold, and Harry tosses the two kings, saying, “Two-for-one?” Walt throws a card among the discards, and says, “You’re on.” (Walt can, of course, also offer a&nbsp;<em>counter proposition</em>. He may say, “For all of them,” and stick his whole stack in, which means, essentially, “I’ll break this hand, but only if we both put all our chips in the pot.” At this point, either Harry agrees, or dumps his hand.) If Walt does not agree to the proposition, preferring instead to take the (small) pot as is, he declines and, in most clubs, Harry must fold.</p>

<p>A bet (often a blind bet) made in a situation in which you have the&nbsp;<em>best of it</em>. This kind of bet is often made in lowball, when both players are drawing cards, and the first player is drawing no more cards than the second. The first player now either openly bets blind (see&nbsp;bet blind), or pretends to look at his draw card, but doesn’t actually see it, and in reality bets blind. Since the opponent makes a 9 or better (the worst hand with which many players call) less than 43 percent of the time even with a one-card draw, the first player has the best of it, and his bet is termed a&nbsp;<em>percentage bet</em>.</p>

<p>A call made by a player in a situation in which he is not a favorite to win, because he is getting better (usually substantially better) than a 1-to-1 return on his investment. For example, in hold’em a player may call a small bet when holding only a high card when it is very likely that the bettor has at least a pair, but makes the call because that bet represents only a small fraction of the amount of money currently in the pot.</p>

<a name='name.P128'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Phil-em Up</h2>
<p>A house-banked game dealt from one deck, to which a&nbsp;joker, good for aces, straights, and flushes, has been added, in which players do not compete against the dealer. The game is related to&nbsp;hold’em in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. Each player receives two cards and three community cards are dealt face down, which will combine with the player’s hole cards to form the player’s five-card hand. After each player sees his two cards, he has the option to double his bet, at which point the dealer reveals the three community cards. Payouts: five aces, 1,000:1; royal flush, 250:1; royal flush with joker, 100:1; straight flush, 50:1; straight flush with joker, 25:1; four of a kind, 20:1; full house, 15:1; flush, 9:1; straight, 7:1; three of a kind, 3:1; two pair, 2:1; pair of 10s or better, 1:1.</p>

<a name='name.P204'>&nbsp;</a><h2>play four poker</h2>
<p>A house-banked game dealt from one deck, similar to&nbsp;three-card poker (definition 2). Each player and the dealer receives five cards from which to make four-card poker hands (with four-card straights and four-card flushes as ranking hands, and hands ranked thus: royal flush, four of a kind, straight flush, three of a kind, flush, straight, two pair, pair); only the best four cards in each hand are used to determine winners. Two bets can be made, and they are played and paid separately. An optional jacks or better bet pays even money on two jacks or better, 2:1 on two pair, 3:1 on three of a kind, 4:1 on either a four-card straight or flush, 25:1 on a straight flush, 75:1 on four of a kind and 200:1 on a four-card royal flush (ace through jack of the same suit). Anything less loses the bet. For the original bet (the ante), a player is paid, if he stays, on certain holdings according to a pay table: 3:1 for a straight flush, 8:1 for four of a kind, and 20:1 for a royal flush. After seeing his hand, a player can either fold or stay in the game by making a second bet equal to the ante (the&nbsp;<em>play bet</em>), and then his hand competes against the dealer’s. If the player does not make the play bet, he loses the original bet. If the dealer does not have a qualifying hand of king-queen or better, the player is paid even money on the ante and nothing on play. If the dealer does qualify, then hands are compared. If the dealer wins, the player loses both ante and play. If the player wins, the ante and play are both paid at even money. Regardless of whether the dealer qualifies or whether the player beats the dealer, the bonuses listed earlier are paid for a straight flush or better. Also see&nbsp;crazy four poker.</p>

<p>Make a comment about the efficacy of a particular play based on its outcome. This is a fallacy, because a play is either good or bad, or has positive or negative&nbsp;expectation, and whether the play succeeded does not necessarily mean the play was good or bad. For example, if someone raised in a no-limit hold’em game so much before the flop that he drove out a competitor that would have flopped a set, thereby saving himself money on that one play, the play may have been wrong (that is, in the long run had less&nbsp;expected value) if in the long run he would have made more by keeping the player in with a smaller raise. “I raised so much with my pocket aces that only the big blind played with his pocket kings. The button folded pocket nines. A nine came on the flop and he would have beat me.” That’s&nbsp;<em>playing results</em>.</p>

<a name='name.P327'>&nbsp;</a><h2>position</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Where a player sits in relation to the others at the table.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Where a player sits in relation to the dealer , or, sometimes, in relation to the blinds.&nbsp;<em>Position 1</em> is generally the position to the left of the current dealer, although, in a&nbsp;two-blind traveling blind game or&nbsp;three-blind traveling blind game,&nbsp;<em>position 1</em> could be the position to the left of the&nbsp;big blind, that is,&nbsp;<em>position 1</em> is three positions to the left of the dealer. Mike Caro reckons position as the number of players remaining to act. Thus, in an eight-player game, the position to the left of the dealer is&nbsp;<em>position 7</em>, while the dealer position is&nbsp;<em>position 0</em>. The compiler of this dictionary has extended this in his writings to blind games, wherein the position immediately to the left of the&nbsp;<em>big blind</em> (in an eight-handed game) is&nbsp;<em>position 7</em>, the dealer is&nbsp;<em>position 2</em>, the&nbsp;small blind or&nbsp;middle blind is&nbsp;<em>position 1</em>, and the big blind is&nbsp;<em>position 0</em> (because no players act after him). Also see&nbsp;early position,&nbsp;late position.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Where a player sits in relation to a particular player. Sitting to someone’s left is generally termed&nbsp;<em>good position</em>, and to his right&nbsp;<em>bad position</em>.&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> Good position with respect to the other players at the table. “You can open with a worse hand when you’ve got position.”&nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> Sitting in good position with respect to a particular player, usually sitting one or two seats to the player’s left; often followed by&nbsp;<em>on</em>. “I had position on the live one all night, but I never held any hands.”</p>

<a name='name.P341'>&nbsp;</a><h2>possible</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> In high poker, a hand that needs one card to be completed, as four cards to a flush or straight. For example, in seven-card stud, after the last card is dealt, you have on your board three spades in sequence, possibly even four. Together with your three downcards, there exists a great possibility that you have a straight or better. A player may have board cards that rank higher than yours, such as a pair, but that player is afraid of your possibilities. When it is his turn to initiate the betting, he might say, “Check to the possible.”&nbsp;<strong>— </strong>&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> In stud games, the description, often by the dealer of the hand, of a hand that could, based on its exposed cards, be part of a complete hand, such as a flush or straight. For example, in a five-card stud game, one player has four spades showing; another has K-Q-10-9, so that a jack in the hole would give him a straight. As the dealer distributes the last round of cards, he might say, “Possible flush, possible straight, pair of aces. Pair of aces is high.”</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.P342'>&nbsp;</a><h2>possible outs</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Outs that improve a drawing hand but might not necessarily win because they might make a better hand for an opponent. For example, a player holds <q class='s'>A</q><q class='s'>J</q> and the board is <q class='d'>5</q><q class='s'>K</q><q class='s'>6</q><q class='d'>T</q>.&nbsp;Ten&nbsp;cards are&nbsp;<em>guaranteed outs</em> (also&nbsp;<em>clean outs</em>). The <q class='s'>Q</q>, <q class='s'>9</q>, <q class='s'>8</q>, <q class='s'>7</q>, <q class='s'>6</q>, <q class='s'>4</q>, <q class='s'>3</q>, and <q class='s'>2</q> make the nut flush. The <q class='h'>Q</q> and <q class='c'>Q</q> make the nut straight. The <q class='s'>5</q> and <q class='s'>T</q> are&nbsp;<em>possible outs</em>, because, while they make the player an ace-high flush, those cards could also make a full house for an opponent. Similarly, the <q class='d'>Q</q> makes the player an ace-high straight, but it would also make a flush for an opponent who holds two diamonds. In addition, any ace or jack is a possible out against an opponent who figures to have either a small pair in the hole or has only a 5, 6, or 10; an ace would also be good against an opponent who has only a king. Also,&nbsp;<em>potential outs</em>.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.P343'>&nbsp;</a><h2>post</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> In a game with blinds, to get dealt in immediately when you first sit down and you are not in the big blind position, put in a blind the same size as the big blind. This way you can be dealt in without waiting for the blind. (See&nbsp;wait for the blind.) (Some cardrooms allow a player who just came into a game to be dealt in without posting.)&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Put up a missed blind. If you miss playing one or more blinds in a particular round, probably because you were away from the table, the house dealer may ask if you want to&nbsp;<em>post</em>, that is, put in as many chips as are in the blind or blinds you missed.<em> </em>For example, in a $2-$4 limit hold’em game (where the blinds are $1 and $2), if you miss the blinds and do not wait for the big blind to get to you to get back into play, you would put $3 into the pot, of which $2 would be considered part of your bet when it is your turn to act on the first round, and $1 would belong to the pot — to be won by the eventual winner of the pot. (The amount equal to the size of the small blind is called&nbsp;dead money. If you miss only the small blind, the chips placed in the pot are also dead money.) When the action gets to you, you have already called one bet, and, if the pot has not been raised, you do not have to put any more chips in the pot. (You can, of course, raise in turn.) This is not the same as an&nbsp;overblind or&nbsp;kill, in which the action temporarily skips the player who has put the blind chips in the pot, and which causes the limit to increase.&nbsp;<strong>3. </strong>Put in one of the blinds, often as part of the expression&nbsp;<em>post a/the blind</em>. — &nbsp;<strong>4. </strong>The chips representing such a bet. “You can’t deal Emilie out; she’s got a post in.”</p>

<a name='name.P359'>&nbsp;</a><h2>pot limit</h2>
<p>A game whose betting limit is always equal to the current size of the pot. A raise can include the size of the pot after the call is accounted for. For example, each player in an eight-player game antes $1. The maximum the first player can open for is $8. If he does, a player can raise that bet by $24 ($8 in antes plus the $8 bet plus the $8 it takes to call that bet). At this point it takes $32 to call (the original $8 bet and the $24 raise), which brings the pot to $80. That bet could now be raised by a maximum of $80, and so on, till everyone is all in. (In a game with two blinds in multiples of 1 and 2 — as blinds of $1 and $2 or $25 and $50 — the maximum opening bet, or&nbsp;bring-in, that can be made from any position except the small blind is 7 times the size of the small blind.) (In some games, the bet or raise can be rounded up, so if the bring-in in a game with blinds of $1 and $2 is $5, the next raise could be $15.) Compare withno limit.</p>

<a name='name.P418'>&nbsp;</a><h2>progressive jackpot</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;jackpot that increases the longer it goes without being hit. When casinos (perhaps cardrooms located at different properties owned by one concern) pool their jackpots, those jackpots can quickly get very large; those jackpots are correspondingly hard to hit, usually because the requirements are more stringent. These latter are called&nbsp;<em>linked jackpots</em>.</p>

<a name='name.P419'>&nbsp;</a><h2>progressive jackpots</h2>
<p>A form of draw poker found mainly in home games in which the opener must have at least a pair of jacks to open, and be prepared to&nbsp;show openers before the pot is out of play; if no one opens, players ante again, sometimes the next dealer deals, and the minimum opening requirements increase to queens, and so on if no one again opens. Sometimes the opening requirements after passed pots stop at aces ; sometimes they continue to increase (to two pair, and so on). Pots can grow quite large from just the antes. See&nbsp;jackpots.</p>

<a name='name.P427'>&nbsp;</a><h2>proposition</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> An offer by one player to another to play under certain circumstances, usually more favorable to the other player, in exchange for calling a bet. Propositions are found mainly in no-limit lowball games. For example, one player raises. The player who opened the pot asks, “Two-for-one?” He is offering a<em>proposition</em>, which is, in effect, saying, “I need to draw two cards to this hand. I would not normally call your raise, but you look like a sporting fellow, so I will call and draw two cards if you agree that you will take one card. If you have to break a pat hand to comply, then so be it; I will not play otherwise.” Gentlemen do not offer a proposition and then renege. In other words, if you offer, for example, two-for-one, it’s not considered sporting to then draw only one or stand pat after the other has thrown his card, nor is it sporting on his part to accept and then stand pat. (Of course, he could accept and draw&nbsp;<em>two</em>, because that is more of a gamble than the offerer of the proposition was requesting or expecting.) If someone offers you a proposition, naturally you can decline. Again, the sporting thing to do in this example is not to say, “Oh, I’m probably drawing anyway,” and then stand pat. If you don’t want to give away anything about your intentions, you can say, “Just call the bet, or throw away your hand,” or say nothing. Just don’t out-and-out lie. While permitted, it’s not sporting, and it will lose you respect and action later. A&nbsp;<em>counter proposition</em> (described under&nbsp;pass for a prop) is also a possibility.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> An agreement between two or more players to always take part in a certain gamble when circumstances warrant, such as&nbsp;open blind, raise blind (definition 2) or&nbsp;two-three.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> A side bet on something not directly related to the play of a hand, as offered by a&nbsp;proposition hustler.</p>

<a name='name.P436'>&nbsp;</a><h2>protect</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Hold onto your cards, as opposed to leaving them sit on the table, such that the dealer cannot accidentally scoop up your hand, and such that it cannot be otherwise fouled.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Place a chip (or other object: see&nbsp;card protector) atop your cards so that no cards falling on them can foul the hand; usually followed by&nbsp;<em>your hand</em> or&nbsp;<em>the hand</em>.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Do the same with the deck (by the&nbsp;player dealer or the&nbsp;house dealer) after dealing the first round of cards, so that discards cannot accidentally get mixed in with the deck; usually followed by&nbsp;<em>the deck</em>. “Hey, dealer, protect the deck,” means the cards are just sitting on the table, and a player wants the dealer to put a chip on top of the deck.&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> Bet in such a way as to increase the chances of an&nbsp;all-in player winning a pot, that is, ensure a showdown between only the bettor and the all-in player. For example, in a no-limit hold’em game with blinds of $5 and $10, Chris has $200, while Matt, Katie, and Paul all have over $2,000. Chris opens for $10, and Matt, Katie, and Paul all call. On the flop, everyone checks. On the turn, Chris bets $40, and Matt raises to $100. Katie calls, and Paul raises another $400. Chris calls all of his remaining chips. Matt and Katie call the reraise, creating a $900&nbsp;side pot. Being all in, Chris cannot bet on the river. Matt and Katie both pass. Now Paul says, “I’ll protect your hand, Chris,” and bets $1,500. If Matt and Katie now both fold, Chris has a better chance of winning the main pot (and Paul can make money even if he was bluffing, by winning the now-uncontested side pot). Compare with&nbsp;dry pot.&nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> When you have a blind in a blind game, invest more money so money you’ve already put in the pot isn’t “wasted.” “Paul always protects his blind, no matter what his cards are or how many bets it costs.” See&nbsp;make the blind good.&nbsp;<strong>6. </strong>See&nbsp;protect the other players.&nbsp;<strong>7.</strong> Bet in such a way as to make other players pay for the privilege of trying to beat your hand, a hand that is currently the leader, but could easily be outdrawn on the next card in a stud or&nbsp;flop game or on the draw in a draw game. “I went all in to protect my two pair.”&nbsp;<strong>8.</strong> What a cardroom does to see that thieves do not prey on its customers.

<a name='name.P439'>&nbsp;</a><h2>protected bet</h2>
<p>A bet made in a situation such that it is likely to win or lose a pot based on the comparative value of a hand, without having to introduce the complication of bluffing. For example, in a limit hold’em game, Norman, an aggressive player, has been betting the flop and the turn with two spades on the board. You flopped middle pair, and intend to call all the way. Behind you sits Matt, a player capable of raising with less than the best hand, even a bluff; he will, of course, also raise with the best hand. Another spade comes on the river. Norman bets and you call. Normally you would be worried about Matt, because when you just call, if he raises and reopens the betting, you’ll have trouble calling if Norman reraises. But Matt has exactly one big bet left. Because he cannot raise, your call was a&nbsp;<em>protected bet</em>. If you have the best hand, you win, and you don’t have to worry about being bluffed.

<a name='name.P441'>&nbsp;</a><h2>protected hand</h2>
<p>A hand in a situation such that it is likely to win or lose a pot based on the comparative merits of its value, without having to introduce the complication of bluffing, because of the dynamics of the participant situation. For example, in a limit hold’em game, a solid player raised from a middle position. A very&nbsp;live (definition 3) player called from the small blind. This player could have any two cards. You called in the big blind with J-10 suited. It’s now the river, and the board shows A-2-10-7. The small blind and you checked the flop and turn and the raiser bet and both of you called. A jack comes on the turn and the small blind bets. If it were just you and the small blind, you would raise. You do not want to raise here, though, because the opener would put in another bet if he has a hand better than yours and if he reraises, you will have wasted an extra bet (because you’ll likely fold for the reraise). If he has just a lone ace, he will just call. Just calling the bet offers potential odds of better than 9-to-1. Neglecting bluffing from the opener, you should win the pot in this situation more than one-tenth of the time, giving you&nbsp;positive expectation. At least a tenth of the time, neither player will beat your top pair. And you&nbsp;<em>can</em> neglect bluffing. That is, the opener has to play his hand “properly.” If he has worse than your hand, he must either call or fold; if he raises, he really has a better hand than yours. Had it been just you and the opener in this spot, you probably would not even have played the hand. But when the other player is added into the mix, if the opener raises, you know he really has a better hand and do not have to consider calling an extra bet. The opener would be very unlikely to raise on a bluff, not because of your hand, but because the small blind is a&nbsp;calling station. Since the opener is unlikely to bluff in this situation, your hand is a&nbsp;<em>protected hand</em>.</p>
<p>The protected hand situation is even better illustrated by draw poker situations. For example, in a straight limit&nbsp;ace-to-five lowball game, a solid player opens the pot in a middle position. A very live player calls on the small blind. This player is likely drawing to a rough hand or drawing two cards. You have the big blind; your hand is a rough 10, say 10-9-8-7-6. If it were just you and the small blind, you would raise. You do not want to raise, though, because the opener is either drawing to a very good hand or already has a&nbsp;pat hand better than yours, and if he reraises, you will have wasted an extra bet (because you’ll likely fold for the reraise). Just calling the half a bet offers odds of better than 5-to-1. Neglecting bluffing, you should win the pot in this situation more than one-sixth of the time, giving you&nbsp;positive expectation. At least a sixth of the time, both players will be drawing and will both miss. And you&nbsp;<em>can</em> neglect bluffing, because, if the small blind passes after the draw, you will pass also to see what the opener does. Now, whether the small blind draws one or two cards, the opener has to play his hand properly. That is, if he has a one-card draw, he must draw one card; if he stands pat, he really has a pat hand better than yours. Had it been just you and the opener, you probably would not stand pat without raising and then check after the draw. If you stand pat, the opener likely would stand pat with a better 10 and might stand pat with worse, reasoning that you would be hard put to call a bet. But when the other player is added into the mix, if the opener stands pat, you know he really has a pat hand and do not have to consider calling a bet. Also, if he draws and bets, again you don’t have to call a bet. The opener would be very unlikely to bluff, not because of your hand, but because the small blind is a calling station. The small blind could very well be drawing to an 8 or 9, which he would pass if he made but then call either your or the opener’s bet. Since the opener is unlikely to bluff in this situation, your hand is a&nbsp;<em>protected hand</em>.</p>

<a name='name.P443'>&nbsp;</a><h2>protection bet</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> In a&nbsp;big bet game, a bet, usually relatively small, made in a vulnerable position in a stud or hold’em game or after the draw in a draw game, to avoid having to call a larger bet from a potentially better hand or from a possible bluff. For example, in pot-limit hold’em, on the river a&nbsp;scare card comes. You have a vulnerable hand you do not want to lay down, say two pair against an aggressive player; neither do you want to call a big bet if you’re beat. The pot contains $100. You do not want to check, because the aggressive player might bet the pot on anything from a bluff to one pair to a good hand that beats yours. So you now bet $20. That is a protection bet, because the other player will likely not raise with a medium hand (like just one pair or two pair that could be smaller than yours if the river card hit you). Of course, aggressive players often take advantage of weak-appearing bets by raising large in such situations.
