<a name='name.S028'>&nbsp;</a><h2>save</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> In a tournament, make an agreement near the end to allocate some of the prize money for first place to lower places. For example, if first place is worth $2,000 and second $1,000, two players might agree to&nbsp;<em>save</em> $200 and play for the rest. This way, second place would be worth $1200 and first $1800. In another example, nine players might be at the final table in a $100-buy-in tournament that pays only the top six places. They might agree before starting final-table play to save $100 for places seven through nine, the amount to come out of first place or perhaps first and second. That way, everyone who made it to the final table would be guaranteed something. Compare with&nbsp;split (definition 5).&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Make an agreement, between two or more players, to pay the others when one wins a pot. For example, if you and I are&nbsp;<em>saving antes</em>, each time you win a pot, you throw me an ante chip, and each time I win one, I throw you a chip. Also see&nbsp;backline.&nbsp;<strong>— </strong>&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> The agreement described in definition 1. “I broke even on the tournament because the players agreed to a save at the final table.”</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.S029'>&nbsp;</a><h2>save bets</h2>
<p>Make a similar agreement to that described under&nbsp;save (definition 2), except that players involved in such an agreement return all of what the others have invested in the pot. For example, if you and I are saving bets, and you win a pot in which we both play, you return to me everything I put in the pot, and vice versa. In such cases, you and I make money if we are both in a pot only if someone else is in. This procedure is not permitted in most cardrooms, because it looks like a form of&nbsp;collusion to the other players. (Sometimes such an arrangement is only for one chip per bet. That way, either player makes money even in a pot against the other.) Also&nbsp;<em>push bets.</em> Also see&nbsp;backline.</p>

For example, buying cheap clothes from a factory that specializes in making knockoff copies of designer clothes and then selling them in a cardroom as first-class items that were supposedly part of a hijacked truck shipment, because people think they’re getting a great deal if they buy something for seemingly less than it’s worth because it’s apparently “hot,” is the “hot clothing scam.” (Usually accompanied by a coy announcement that the item “fell off the truck.”)&nbsp;<strong>— </strong>&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Use a scam. “They got barred from the club after the manager discovered they were scamming.”&nbsp;<strong>— </strong>&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> Use a scam on someone or something. “They were scamming the game.”</p>

<a name='name.S040'>&nbsp;</a><h2>scare card</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> In hold’em, the appearance of a&nbsp;board card that presents the possibility of a better hand. For example, if you have pocket queens and an ace or king appears, that is a&nbsp;<em>scare card</em> because it might make a bigger pair for an opponent. Similarly, if you hold two pair or three of a kind, the appearance of a third or fourth suited card or card in sequence is a scare card.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> In stud, the appearance on a player’s board of a card that appears likely to have improved the player’s hand. For example, a player who received an ace, a 10, and a jack as his first three upcards, and then caught a king on&nbsp;sixth street, has definitely been dealt a scare card, because he can easily have or make a high straight.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> In draw, a good card inadvertently turned up in a player’s hand, supposedly frightening opponents.</p>

<a name='name.S042'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Scarne cut</h2>
<p>A form of cut in which the cutter holds the cards in one hand, removes the bottom half with the other and places them atop the remaining half, pulls a packet from the center and places those cards on top of the remaining cards. This cut is named after John Scarne, who lectured and wrote about gambling thieves, and introduced this form of cut as a means of foiling cheaters who had stacked the deck. The Scarne cut is not permitted in most public cardrooms, where the deck must not be lifted from the table and must be cut with one hand. Sometimes called&nbsp;<em>doghouse cut</em>,&nbsp;<em>whorehouse cut</em>.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.S045'>&nbsp;</a><h2>schooling</h2>
<p>The situation in which multiple players make bad calls but the individual calls each become not so bad because of the presence of the other callers. Each call of the original bet brings others who see the pot getting larger and their chances improving, which in turn brings more. This effect explains why you sometimes see eight players in a capped hold’em pot, with several holding hands (like 7-5) they would not play for even a single bet if only one or two others were in the pot. This also explains why those who play good cards claim they can’t beat loose games; what gets them is the high&nbsp;variance intrinsic in such games. The term comes from what&nbsp;fish do.</p>

<a name='name.S046'>&nbsp;</a><h2>schmengie</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Put a&nbsp;bad beat on someone.

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Win all of the pot in a high-low poker game that does not have a&nbsp;declaration (definition 2) by having both the highest and the lowest hand.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Win all of the pot in a high-low poker game that does not have a declare by having the best hand for one way and no one has a&nbsp;qualifier for the other way. For example, in high-low seven-stud,&nbsp;8-or-better, if your full house is the best high hand and no one has an 8-low or better, you&nbsp;<em>scoop</em> the pot.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Declare both ways in a high-low poker game that has a declaration.&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> Win both ways in a high-low poker game that has a declare. (Just because you&nbsp;<em>declare</em> both ways does not necessarily mean you’ll&nbsp;<em>win</em> both ways.) Also called&nbsp;<em>shoot the moon</em> (usually only in home games) for definitions 3 and 4, and&nbsp;<em>sweep</em> for 1.&nbsp;<strong>— </strong>&nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> A game in which a player who wins two pots in a row (or wins one pot over a certain amount, usually in a high-low split game) must post a blind on the next hand such that the game is played temporarily at a higher limit. That limit is usually either twice the nominal size of the game, or 50 percent higher (half kill). Thus,&nbsp;<em>Omaha scoop</em> might be a $4-$8 game that becomes either $8-$16 or $6-$12 after someone wins two pots in a row (or wins a pot greater than, say, 10 bets&nbsp;strange in&nbsp;Omaha 8-or-better). When a&nbsp;board man announces the game, he might refer to it just as&nbsp;<em>scoop</em>, particularly if it’s the only scoop game in the house. “John, your scoop seat is open.”&nbsp;<strong>6.</strong> In a no-limit game, a handful of chips. When a player bets, and the dealer does not know exactly how much the bet is, the dealer might say, “One scoop.” When a bet is raised by approximately the same amount, the dealer might say, “Two scoops.”&nbsp;<strong>7.</strong> In a limit game, two bets, that is, a bet and a raise; often used as a plural. When a player raises, the dealer might say, “Two scoops.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Call. “I’ll see you.” “I’ll see that bet.” The term is used more often in private and home games than in cardrooms and casinos, and seems very popular in Hollywood’s portrayals of poker. (Since the word means call, an expression frequently heard in movies, such as, “I’ll see your thousand and raise a thousand,” is a contradiction in terms — you can’t both call and raise — and brings snickers to poker players.) Often part of the phrase&nbsp;<em>see</em><em> [a] </em><em>bet</em>.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> In&nbsp;proposition betting, recognize and announce that a winning combination has occurred, thereby making it a valid and winning wager, as opposed to&nbsp;sleep a prop, that is, not notice the winning combination, and thus forfeit the payoff.</p>

<a name='name.S116'>&nbsp;</a><h2>semibluff</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> A bet made on a hand that is probably not the best at the time of the bet, but that has a possibility of improving to the best (has one or more&nbsp;outs). If the bet gets everyone else to fold, it succeeds as a bluff; if it does not, the hand might still improve (in stud and hold’em) on succeeding cards or (in draw) on the draw. This term was first popularized in the writings of noted poker author and theorist David Sklansky. For example, in hold’em, if a player has <q class='s'>5</q><q class='s'>6</q> and the board is <q class='s'>K</q><q class='s'>Q</q><q class='h'>4</q> and bets out, if no one has anything, the bettor might win the pot right there. If anyone calls, though, which a player with a king or queen in the hole undoubtedly would do, the bettor is behind, but could still win if another spade appears on the turn or river. Compare with&nbsp;complete bluff. Also see&nbsp;fold equity. — &nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Make such a bet. For both definitions, also&nbsp;<em>semi-bluff</em>.</p>

<a name='name.S147'>&nbsp;</a><h2>setup</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> A box containing two decks of plastic cards. You sometimes hear players ask for “a new setup.” This means they want not just a new deck, but two fresh decks, because in a game that uses plastic cards, often the decks are rotated and not replaced until a specific period of time ends, or until requested (or when the cards become damaged).&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> The act of setting up. The following might be heard in a draw poker game: “He fell for the setup, and so the next time I drew two cards, he called all his chips with two little pair. Of course, that’s when I showed him three aces.” See&nbsp;set up (definition 1).&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Preparation of a victim for being cheated.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.S148'>&nbsp;</a><h2>set up</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Make a bet or action that causes another player to think you always act that way, so that you can take advantage of the misconception later; set a trap for someone. In flop games (see&nbsp;flop game), setting up is accomplished only by giving off misleading tells and by betting patterns. In draw poker, setting up can be done by how you draw. For example, if you raise and draw one card to three of a kind several times, you may be trying to&nbsp;<em>set someone up</em> to think that every time you raise and draw one you have trips (particularly if you rarely raise on two pair). If later you raise and draw two when you&nbsp;<em>really</em>have three of a kind (if things work out the way you want, preferably aces), the player you have been setting up may think you can’t possibly have trips, and will call a large bet after the draw with two pair or possibly even one high pair. (Of course, if things don’t work out the way they’re supposed to, he’ll make a hand that beats your three aces. That’s a chance a good player just has to take.)&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Prepare a victim for being cheated.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Prepare a game or table for play, by, for example, providing cards and chips, cleaning off the table, and so on. “We’ll start a new 20-40 as soon as we can set up a table.”&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> Arrange, as a specific game or contest. “I’m trying to set up a $1,000 freeze-out with Quick.”&nbsp;<strong>— </strong>&nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> Having check cashing privileges (or sometimes just&nbsp;credit) in a particular establishment. “Are you set up in the cage?”</p>

<a name='name.S165'>&nbsp;</a><h2>sevens rule</h2>
<p>In&nbsp;ace-to-five lowball, the rule that states that you must bet a 7 or better (that is, a no-pair hand topped by a 7, 6, or 5) after the draw. Many years ago, in a very few clubs, failing to bet a 7 could cost you the entire pot; more commonly, it would usually cost you only the action (betting) after the draw. In such a case, if a player passes a 7, and then calls with it, if the player who bet has worse than the passed hand, the bettor gets his money back, and the player who passed the 7 wins what was in the pot before the draw; if the player who bet has better than the passed hand, the bettor of course wins the whole pot, that is, the bet after the draw along with the remainder of the pot. The purpose of the rule is to speed up the game (by preventing players from passing good hands, and then waiting for the action to get back to them so they can raise).</p>

<a name='name.S174'>&nbsp;</a><h2>seven-twenty-seven</h2>
<p>A stud game (sort of), played only in home games, in which each player is dealt a downcard, followed by a round of betting, and then one or more cards face up. Aces have a value of 1 or 11, face cards a value of ½, and all other cards have face value. This is a split-pot game, with the object being to end up with a total closest to 7 or 27. On each round, players can either receive a further upcard, or refuse further cards. After any round in which no player takes a card, the players&nbsp;declare which “way” they are going (7 or 27, sometimes called&nbsp;<em>high</em> or&nbsp;<em>low</em>), and there is a showdown. (Sometimes there is one more round of betting before the showdown.) In some versions, once a player refuses upcards a certain number of times (say, three), that player can no longer request further cards. The purpose of this rule is that when a player is in a “lock” (cannot lose) situation, that is, when he is the only one going low, and there are more than one player going high, and who have quit asking for upcards, the player with the lock can prolong the betting by drawing cards to a point at which he cannot hit without destroying his lock. In some games, being on one side or the other of 7 or 27 (when no one has exactly that total) wins over the other side. For example, in some games, 6½ loses to 7½, while in others, the reverse is true. The best hand is some combination that adds up to 7, and includes two aces, so that the hand also adds up to 27. This is a potential&nbsp;<em>scooping hand</em>, but a hand with which a player must be careful at&nbsp;<em>declare</em> time in a game in which the rules dictate that a player who declares for both ways must clearly&nbsp;<em>win</em> both ways (that is, cannot tie for either). While this is not really a&nbsp;<em>poker</em> game, it is very popular in some home games (because it has many of the elements of poker, including bluffing). The main drawback to the game is that each hand usually takes a very long time.&nbsp;<em>Two-twenty-two</em>,&nbsp;<em>three-thirty-three</em>, and&nbsp;<em>four-forty-four</em> are similar games), though less common than&nbsp;<em>seven-twenty-seven</em>.</p>

<p>How a cardroom wants its shills to play. For example, in a seven-card stud game, a shill might not be permitted to play worse than a pair of kings, call a raise with less than three of a kind, call on the end with worse than a straight, and be required to fold (no matter what she has) if another shill bets. Such rules are not meant to be a winning strategy. The purpose of a shill is only to fill a seat until a&nbsp;live player shows up.</p>

When the situation arises, generally someone who did not see the hand chants, “Show one, show all,” makes a fuss, and either the dealer turns over the hand in question (sometimes first killing the hand; see&nbsp;kill, definition 2), or calls a floorman to make a decision.

<p>In a game with minimum&nbsp;opening requirements, such as&nbsp;jacks or better, prove that you had&nbsp;openers when you opened a pot. If you opened the pot and then bet after the draw and are not called, or if you fold, you must&nbsp;<em>show openers</em>. You do so by showing only as much of the hand as it takes. That is, if you opened with three jacks, you need show only two of them, but if you opened with a pat straight, you must show the entire hand. If you opened with a full house, 10s full of 3s, you need show only the three 10s (or four cards that constitute two pair); with 7s full of jacks, you need show only the two jacks.</p>

<a name='name.S325'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Silverado Stud</h2>
<p>A house-banked game, played in South Dakota, dealt from one deck, in which players do not compete against the dealer. The game is related to&nbsp;hold’em in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. Each player makes two equal bets, one on the 3-card hand he will end up with and one on his eventual 5-card hand. Each player then receives 4 cards and two cards are dealt face down as community cards. Each player discards one of his starting cards. Exception: If the player starts with four of a kind, he immediately informs the dealer and receives a payment of 50:1 and ends the hand. The dealer then turns over one community card and each player can make a third bet, equal to the first, which will play with the five-card hand. The dealer then turns over the second community card and settles each hand, paying the three-card hands according to one pay table and the five-card hands according to another. The three-card hand starts paying with any pair, at 1:1, while the five-card hand pays, at 1:1, on two jacks or better. Both pay correspondingly more for better hands.</p>

<a name='name.S330'>&nbsp;</a><h2>single-chip rule</h2>
<p>The rule, enforced in many cardrooms, that, when responding to action, a player puts into the pot a single chip or bill with a denomination larger than the bet indicated at that juncture, but does not announce a raise, that player’s action is ruled to have been only a call. The single-chip or bill rule also applies when more than one chip is necessary to call a bet, but the last chip might be construed as a raise. The preceding applies to all rounds in limit games. In no-limit games, on the first round, the opening bet made with an over-sized chip or bill on the first round is considered a call of the bring-in amount; on any succeeding round, the first bet is equal to the size of the over-sized chip or bill, unless an announcement to the contrary is made. In stud games a single oversized chip or bill does not automatically complete a forced bring-in bet unless it is verbally declared to do so. Two examples clarify this rule. (1) The main chips in a $20-limit hold’em game are $5 chips. Andy has just exchanged a rack of $5 chips for five $100 chips, and has only four $5 chips left. He loses these on the next hand, leaving him only those $100 chips. On the next hand, Brianne limps for $20. Andy throws in one of his $100 chips. Unless Andy says “I raise,” or words to that effect, by the single-chip rule he has only called, and the house dealer would give Andy $80 change. There might be some raising. Say the betting is capped, perhaps at five bets. On the flop, Brianne bets $20. Andy throws in another of his $100 bets. This is also understood to be only a call. (2) In a no-limit game, the same happens. On the first round of betting of the hand in question, again Brianne limps for $20. Andy throws in one of his $100 chips. Again, by the single-chip rule he has only called. Now, Brandon announces a raise of $80. Brianne folds and Andy calls the raise with the $80 in change the house dealer initially gave him for the $100 chip. On the flop, Andy is first to bet. He tosses in a $100 chip. This being a no-limit game, his bet is understood to be $100. Also known as&nbsp;<em>one-chip rule, oversized-chip rule</em>.</p>

When one player puts out a large stack of chips, and another player calls by placing in the pot more chips than are required for the call (and either does not say the magic word “Raise” or obviously does not have enough chips to constitute a raise), the dealer may not count the first player’s chips, but merely places the second stack of chips next to the first, and removes enough chips from the second stack until the two stacks are equal in height. This method originated with dealers in casino percentage games (such as 21 or craps), who paid off winning bets this way, so that watchers (security personnel, perhaps occupying the “eye in the sky”) could clearly see that the payoff was correct.</p>

<a name='name.S429'>&nbsp;</a><h2>slow roll</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> The practice by some players, at the showdown, when they have the best hand, of waiting till the last possible moment before showing that hand. This is usually done for one of three reasons: to see everyone else’s cards first, to&nbsp;needle one or more of the&nbsp;active players, or just out of pure orneriness.&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong>Closely related, the practice by some players, at the showdown, when calling a bet with the best hand, of waiting a long time before revealing the hand for the purpose of annoying the bettor or just out of pure orneriness. Sometimes this happens quite innocently because the caller is not sure what the bettor actually has when the hand is revealed and has to study the hand briefly before showing his own. When this happens, the irascible or impatient player who bet might comment, “Nice slow roll.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Easy to beat. “Get in; it’s a soft game.”&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Smooth, as a&nbsp;<em>soft 8</em>.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> In lowball, pertaining to a limit game played at slighter higher than its normal stakes. For example, a&nbsp;<em>soft 8</em> starts out as a $6-limit game, and then the players agree to slightly increase the size of the game by adding $1 to the big blind. Instead of three blinds at $1-$2-$3, it becomes $1-$2-$4 and $8-limit. This is not the same as a&nbsp;<em>straight 8</em>, whose blinds are $2-$2-$4. Similarly, a nominal $8-limit game might become a&nbsp;<em>soft 10</em>, with blinds of $2-$2-$5, instead of the usual $2-$3-$5. The point of all this is to play at the next higher level without having to pay the&nbsp;time for that size game.&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> Pertaining to currency. For example, when requesting change in currency (as opposed to chips), a request made by a dealer to a floorman for “$20 chips, $80 soft” indicates a player has a $100 bill and wants only $20 of it in chips. See&nbsp;hard.&nbsp;<strong>—</strong> &nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> Without putting pressure on. “He always plays her soft” means that when he gets in a pot with this particular young lady, he does not bluff her, nor does he try to push her around with aggressive betting.

<a name='name.S483'>&nbsp;</a><h2>soft-play</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Put no pressure on, as described under&nbsp;soft (definition 5).&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Use a form of&nbsp;collusion in which players have an agreement not to bet or raise each other with anything less than big hands (for the situation); that is, they specifically do not bet weak hands or bluffs when they are in a pot with each other. This is done to prevent participants from jointly losing chips to other players. For example, in hold’em, if one player bets middle set and his “friend” raises, the friend is guaranteed to have top set or better. Thus the first can safely fold if he doesn’t have money odds to continue. If a player not in on the agreement happens to make a better hand, he wins money only from the better of the two (putative) colluders.&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Rarely,&nbsp;slow-play.</p>

<p>Poker in which the betting limits lie somewhere between&nbsp;single limit and&nbsp;no limit. Bets have a range, from a minimum to a maximum.

As in no-limit games, a raise must always at least equal the previous bet or raise (unless the player making the raise is going&nbsp;all in, in which case the interpretation varies from club to club). That is, if one player bets $2 and the next player raises $3, any other player to come into the pot who wishes to raise must raise at least $3; a $2 raise is not permitted at this point.

<p>In a game with only antes (but probably not in a stud game with a&nbsp;forced bring-in), win just the antes by bluffing; get everyone to fold, usually by opening in late position when no one else appears to be interested in the pot, before there is any real action, and thus win the antes.</p>

<a name='name.S645'>&nbsp;</a><h2>steal the blinds</h2>
<p>Win just the blinds by bluffing; get the blinds to fold, usually by opening or raising in late position, and thus win the blinds. The hand one holds when making such a move is not necessarily worse than that held by the blinds, but it is worse than the hand that would on average be the best for the position. For example, if, in hold’em, one comes into the pot for a raise when holding 9-7 unsuited, that hand&nbsp;<em>may</em> be better than what either of the blinds holds (but often isn’t), such a play is still considered to be stealing the blinds.

<a name='name.S669'>&nbsp;</a><h2>step tournament</h2>
<p>A series of, generally, single-table tournaments, often&nbsp;sit-and-go, usually online, with multiple levels, each of which leads participants to the next higher level, each succeeding level of which can also be the starting point, at a higher buy-in than the level below, generally culminating in a prize of a buy-in to a major tournament. For example, players might buy in at the lowest level for $7.50 or a moderate number of&nbsp;frequent player points. First and second places would pay an entry into the next level, which could also be bought in to for $27 cash or more frequent player points than required for the first step; third and fourth places might offer buy-ins to the lowest level. Each succeeding step would offer similar choices, with either advancement, buy-ins to the same level, or, perhaps for fourth and fifth places, buy-ins to a lower level. The progression might continue $82, $700, and $2100. First place at the highest level might win a package consisting of a buy-in to a major $10,000 tournament, transportation, spending money, and hotel accommodations, a package that might be worth $15,000. At the final step, paying places after first usually receive cash rather than step buy-ins. Prizes in the form of buy-ins to step levels are called<em>tournament tickets</em>.

<a name='name.S716'>&nbsp;</a><h2>string bet</h2>
<p>An illegal bet, because it was not made all in one motion. The concept of string bets is complicated (and not just because it is interpreted differently from club to club). If you want to raise a bet, you are supposed to have as many chips in your hand as you need to cover the bet you are raising plus sufficient chips to include your raise when you put your hand in the pot, and then release all of them before withdrawing your hand. Similarly, if you wish to bet more than the minimum in a no-limit game, you are supposed to have as many chips as you wish to bet in your hand. Most clubs permit you to say the magic words, “I raise” (or something that means the same, even something as nebulous as “Going up!”) or, in the case of a bet, “I bet” (or something interpretable as synonymous), and then make one or more trips back to your stack for more chips. In the absence of the preceding conditions, you are likely to be guilty of making a&nbsp;<em>string bet</em>, the penalty for which is being permitted only to call the preceding bet, or put in the pot only as many chips as you currently have in your hand (or, in the case of a bet in a no-limit game, bet only the minimum for the game). Watch out! The string bet situation trips up more players than almost any other rule. The rationale behind prohibiting string bets is that, in former times, a player might put in part of his bet, hesitate long enough to see the reactions of other players, and then, based on those reactions, perhaps increase the bet.</p>

<a name='name.S726'>&nbsp;</a><h2>strip poker</h2>
<p>A form of poker, generally played in mixed company, in which players use articles of clothing to purchase chips (or articles of clothing as the actual wagering units). As players need more chips, they must remove clothing; sometimes (rarely) the winners put those articles on. In some versions of the game, in each hand, all but the winner of the pot must remove one article of clothing; the drawback to this is the lack of an ante, unless players ante with clothing, in which case a disproportionate value is placed on any one article of clothing. This form of poker is not really related to the true nature of poker, whose goal is, for each player, to win money; the underlying nature of strip poker is to get almost everyone naked. A related game is&nbsp;sex poker.</p>

<a name='name.S744'>&nbsp;</a><h2>stud-horse poker</h2>
<p>Supposedly an early form of&nbsp;stud poker, but, in fact, a game that no one really knows how to play. A portion of the California Constitution (Section 330) legislates against certain games of chance by name, including roulette, blackjack, something called lansquenet, and, notably, stud-horse poker. Even though attorneys-general of the state had no idea what the game was, they used that apparent ban for a long time to prevent the playing of any form of poker that was not&nbsp;draw. Some historians think stud-horse poker was a variant of three-card monte, that is, a sucker game in which the sucker had no chance. Eventually (in the 1980s) the government quit prosecuting clubs in which hold’em was played, because judges ruled it was not stud. Once the “door was opened,” other games were permitted, including stud itself, and even games like super pan 9, California aces, and 21st Century Blackjack that clearly bear little resemblance to poker. And nobody knows&nbsp;<em>yet</em> what stud-horse poker&nbsp;<em>is</em>.</p>

<p>An online player who is able to see the hidden cards of other players. This is cheating, and for a long time was thought impossible, but some of the largest sites revealed that former insiders actually had exploited development holes in the code to do just that. In major scandals in 2007 and 2008, these sites paid back millions to players and supposedly reengineered their code so that this could no longer happen. Whether superusers currently exist on these and other sites is unlikely, and the well-known sites are taking measures to ensure it doesn’t happen. Many poker authorities believe that the top sites have too much at stake to allow this or any other form of cheating to go on. The term comes from wider usage in the computer world of the system operator (sysop) that has special privileges that allow him to make changes to the system and to accounts that “ordinary” users cannot; in that context, the term originated in Unix.</p>
