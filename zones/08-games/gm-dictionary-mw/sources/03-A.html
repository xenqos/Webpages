<p>(<em>adv phrase</em>) With respect to the rules of poker, proper, that is, following the rules.

<div>
<p><strong><a name="37756"></a>ace</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) The highest or lowest card in the deck. If the cards are arranged in order, the ace either starts this sequence: A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-T-J-Q-K; or finishes this one: 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-T-J-Q-K-A. In high poker, the ace is the highest card in a hand, with one exception: when it is part of a 5-high straight, that is, in this hand: A-2-3-4-5, of mixed suits (where it must be the lowest card to make the straight). In low poker (<a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#37159">ace-to-five</a> lowball), especially as played in California cardrooms, the ace is the lowest card in a hand. In high-low (split) poker games, the ace is either high or low, depending on how it is used. It can even be both high and low in some hands. For example, 7♣ 4♣ 3♣ 2♣ A♣ is a 7-low hand, and an ace-high flush. Also called <em class="term">bullet</em>, <em class="term">bull</em>, <em class="term">rocket</em>, <em class="term">seed</em>, <em class="term">spike</em>, and other names.</p>
<div>

<div>
<p><strong>ace-high</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>adj</em>) A term that often modifies (refers to) a straight or flush topped by an ace. “I was drawing to an ace-high flush, but all I made was an ace high.”</p>

<p><strong><a name="40600"></a>ace in the hole</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In a stud game, having an ace as one’s downcard or one of one’s downcards. This being a desirable condition, the expression has moved from the world of poker to general usage in the English language with the wider meaning of an advantage or resource kept in reserve until needed.</p>

This expression has moved from the world of poker to general usage in the English language with the meaning of winning by deception or just barely beating someone in some venture. (If your opponent holds a totally worthless hand, an ace-high hand would just barely beat him; that is, you would <em class="Emphasis">ace</em> him <em class="Emphasis">out</em>.)</p>

<div>
<p><strong><a name="76569"></a>ace-to-five lowball</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) The version of <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#39192">lowball</a> draw, once popular in California (but played in many other areas), in which the lowest card is the ace, and straights and flushes have no significance. The best hand is A-2-3-4-5, sometimes called a <em class="term">wheel</em> or, less commonly, a <em class="term">lowball</em>. Usually the joker is set as the lowest unpaired card in the hand (a very few clubs play ace-to-five lowball without the joker). The game is played <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#18809">bet-or-fold</a> before the draw. <em class="Emphasis">Ace-to-five lowball</em> is also sometimes called <em class="term">California lowball</em>, particularly when the <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#14998">sevens rule</a> is in effect (but all ace-to-five games do not necessarily have the sevens rule). Also see <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#30267">deuce-to-seven</a>. Sometimes called simply <em class="term">ace-to-five</em>. Sometimes shortened to <em class="term">A-to-5 lowball</em> or <em class="term">A-to-5</em>.</p>

Ace-to-six is the hand ranking used in games like <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#39175">London lowball</a> and in some home games.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>ace up the sleeve</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) Describing the situation in which a cheater has withdrawn an ace from the deck and secreted it in his sleeve to be introduced into the game later, or, more generally, has taken some unfair advantage. The expression has moved from the world of poker to general usage in the English language to describe the situation in which someone is hiding some probably unfair advantage.

<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#24818">Two pair</a>, aces and 2s. <strong>2.</strong> In hold’em, A-2 as starting cards. <strong>3.</strong> A non-poker game, usually played in home games, but also found rarely in casinos, in which players bet that a third card in succession will fall in rank between the first two, which are dealt face up before the bet. Sometimes called <em class="term">Red Dog</em>. <strong>4.</strong> A variant of backgammon.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>adj</em>) When you just barely lift the right edge of your drawn card (see <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#37307">squeeze</a>, definition 1 or 2) in lowball such that you can see only the rightmost vertical edge and only down to but not including the index, for any card ace through 10 you see either none, one, two, three, or four vertical pips (see <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#18967">pip</a>). <em class="term">Nothing across</em> is an ace, 2, or 3; <em class="term">two across</em> is a 4 or 5; <em class="term">three across</em> is a 6, 7, or 8; and <em class="term">four across</em> is a 9 or 10. Similar to the discussion under <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#15499">spotter</a>, some lowball players couple the knowledge that a card could be in one of these ranges with game theory to decide on whether or not to bet.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="86684"></a>act</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v</em>) Make a poker play at the required time; bet, call, raise, or fold, as appropriate, in turn. When it’s your turn to do something, someone might say, “It’s your turn to act,” or, “It’s up to you to act.”</p>
<div>
<p><strong>act in turn</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) Play <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5532#92178">in turn</a>, that is, when one is required and specifically not <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5544#11875">out of turn</a>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="38420"></a>action</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> The relative liveliness of a game, often measured by the frequency and quantity of bets and raises. “This game has a lot of action.” Often part of the phrase <em class="term">fast action</em>. <strong>2.</strong> Being required to <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#86684">act</a>. When it’s your turn to do something, someone might say, “It’s your action,” or, “The action is up to you.” <strong>3.</strong> That portion of the pot that a player <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#17946">short</a> of the full bet can win a multiple of. For example, in a no-limit game, if John bets $100, Matt calls the whole $100, and you call, but you have only $20, you are said to have $20 worth of <em class="Emphasis">action</em> in the pot. A <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#38874">side pot</a> of $160 ($80 from each of them) will be created between John and Matt; $20 of John’s bet goes into the <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5540#32500">main pot</a>, as does $20 of Matt’s bet, and all of your bet; you can win the $60 main pot if you win. <strong>4.</strong> A player’s investment, current or potential, in a pot or game, particularly as part of the phrase <em class="term">take someone’s action</em>. For example, in a $20-limit <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#76569">ace-to-five lowball</a> game, the button has killed the pot. Matt, in the middle blind, cannot play. Susie shows Matt her cards prior to throwing them away. She has 4-5-6 and does not want to put in another $30 and possibly face a raise. Matt says, “Play, and I’ll take half your action.” That is, he will give her $15 to play those cards. Whether he would put up half the cost of a subsequent raise and possible action after the draw is not at all clear. Besides, such backing of a hand is not usually permitted, and, furthermore, Matt probably was not serious. <strong>5.</strong> A player’s investment, current or potential, in a pot or game, particularly as part of the phrase <em class="term">take someone’s action</em>. <a class="XRef" href="examples.htm#35275">action</a> Also, if I have staked someone in a game, I have a <em class="term">piece of his action</em>. <strong>6.</strong> Part of the phrase <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5532#14062">in action</a>. — (adj) <strong>7.</strong> Lively, usually loose or liberal. “He’s an action player.” “This is an action game.” Also see <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5528#30501">give action</a>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>action board</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In hold’em, a <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#38662">board</a> that tends to generate <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#38420">action</a>, that is, much betting, calling, and raising. Similar to <em class="term">action flop</em>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="45474"></a>action button</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> A bet that must be posted, in a seven-card stud or Omaha <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5508#32087">8-or-better</a> game (or, sometimes more specifically, the <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#21700">button</a> — definition 3 — signifying that the holder must immediately make the bet), by the winner of a <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#42658">scoop</a> pot above a certain size. For example, if the low card normally must bet $1 in a $5-$10 game, and there is an action button out, anyone who calls the $1 is committing to bet $5 later. No one would call the $1 without intending at least to call the blind raise by the action button. Whether the action button acts in turn, or after everyone else has acted, depends on the cardroom. Posting an action button is not the same as a <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5536#13330">kill</a> (definition 3). <strong>2.</strong> <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#77854">Advance action button</a>. <strong>3.</strong> A button placed by the house dealer in front of the hand that will compete first against the player dealer in <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#23315">California games</a> such as <em class="Emphasis">pai gow poker</em>.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In hold’em, a card appearing on the <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#38662">board</a> that tends to generate <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#38420">action</a>, that is, much betting, calling, and raising. Could be an ace, a paired card, or the third or fourth to a possible straight or flush.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A game with a lot of <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#38420">action</a> (definition 1).</p>
<div>
<p><strong>action only</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In many cardrooms, with respect to an <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#42546">all-in bet</a>, only a full bet is considered a legitimate wager, in terms of whether this constitutes a raise that can be reraised. Anything less than a full bet is considered to be <em class="Emphasis">action only</em>, that is, other players can call such a bet but not raise it. For example, Lili bets $10. Henry calls. John goes <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#17954">all in</a> for $14. When the bet gets back to Lili, she is permitted only to call the extra $4; the same goes for Henry.

<p><strong><a name="40157"></a>angle</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> A maneuver, on the border between legality and illegality (but usually clearly unethical), to take unfair advantage of another player. Extreme example: Some clubs consider putting fewer chips than required into the pot an uncompleted bet that is not valid until completed, and that, furthermore, can be removed until such time as sufficient chips are bet. (Fortunately, there aren’t many such clubs.) In such a club, you bet $100 and another player puts in $99. You show your cards, which have him beat. He says, “I put in only $99; I didn’t call your bet.” He withdraws the chips. Of course, if he had you beat, he would quietly take the whole pot. If someone pointed out at that juncture that he called only $99, he would probably say, “Oh, pardon me, just an oversight; I meant to call,” add the missing chip, and <em class="term">then</em> drag the pot. All of that is part of an <em class="term">angle</em>. See <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#42262">angle shooter</a>. Another example: In a no-limit game, the holder of the big blind might say to the small blind, “If no one else comes in, you put them all in blind and I’ll call you.” Everyone folds to the small blind, who puts in all his chips without looking. The big blind, already looking at this cards, calls. The small blind says, “Hey, you’re looking. We agreed to go all in blind.” The big blind says, “That’s all right. I had already committed. It doesn’t make any difference if I look now.” However, if the big blind didn’t like his cards, he would say, instead, “Oh, I forgot we agreed on that and I already looked.” Another angle is deliberately miscalling one’s hand in an attempt to get the other player to fold a better hand. When caught, the perpetrator claims to have misread his hand. — (<em>v</em>) <strong>2.</strong> Perpetrate an angle. More commonly <em class="term">shoot an angle</em>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="42262"></a>angle shooter</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A poker player who uses various underhanded, unfair methods to take advantage of inexperienced opponents. The difference between an angle shooter and a cheat is only a matter of degree. What a cheat or thief does is patently against the rules; what an angle shooter does may be marginally legal, but is neither ethical nor gentlemanly. Nor is it in the spirit of the game. Unfortunately, poker is not a gentleman’s game. In addition to learning how to protect yourself against cheating players, you must learn to watch out for the angle shooters. See <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#40157">angle</a>.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A casino game, banked by the house, dealt from one deck, in which players do not compete against the dealer. The game is related to hold’em in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. (See <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5542#86892">nonpoker games</a>.) It is also very similar to <a class="XRef" href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#61197">Let It Ride Bonus</a>. Each player has three betting areas marked A, 1, and 2. Each player makes an ante bet in betting area A. Each player receives three cards face down, and two cards are dealt face down as community cards, which will be used by each player to make a five-card hand. Players then look at their cards. Each player decides in turn to continue betting, or stop at just the ante bet. To continue, a player places a bet equal to the ante bet in area 1. The first community card is then turned over. Again each player who has made another bet decides in turn to continue betting, or stop where he is. To continue, a player places a bet equal to the ante bet in area 2. At this point, each player has made one, two, or three bets. The second community card is then turned over. The dealer reveals each hand in turn. If the player does not have a pair of 10s or higher, he loses all bets. Winning payouts are: royal flush, 250:1; straight flush, 50:1; four of a kind, 25:1; full house, 12:1; flush, 10:1; straight, 8:1; three of a kind, 3:1; two pair, 2:1; pair of 10s through aces, 1:1.</p>
