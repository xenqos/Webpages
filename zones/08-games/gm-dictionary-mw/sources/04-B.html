</div>
<p>(<em>vt</em>) <strong>1.</strong> In hold’em (and sometimes seven-card stud), catch two cards in a row on the turn and river to make a straight or flush when a player had only three cards to the hand on the flop (or <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#42678">fifth street</a> in seven-card stud, and then catch the two cards in a row on the sixth and seventh streets); always followed by the name of the hand caught. The term often applies to a hand made on the end that the player of the hand wasn’t trying to make, implying that the player had something else to go for on three cards than the straight or flush. For example, a player starts with A♥ 8♥, and the flop is A♠ 6♦ 4♥. The turn is 9♥, and the river J♥, causing the player to <em>backdoor</em> a flush. See <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#29900">runner-runner</a>. Sometimes the term refers to making four of a kind when a player had a pair in the hole (and nothing else on the flop). “I had a set the whole way, and he backdoored a straight on me.” <strong>2.</strong> Make a hand other than what one was going for. “I flopped a four flush, but I backdoored two more queens and won.” — (<em>adj</em>) <strong>3.</strong> Part of the phrase <em>backdoor flush</em> or <em>backdoor straight</em>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="75632"></a>back into</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) <strong>1. </strong>Win a pot unexpectedly or by default. For example, in hold’em, John has 3-2 offsuit on the big blind and everyone limps so John gets in “for free.” The flop comes A-A-A. If anyone bets, John is prepared to fold. A 5 comes on the turn. Again, no one bets. Now a 4 comes on the river, to complete a straight for John, a hand he would never have made if anyone had bet. John <em>backed into</em> the pot. <strong>2.</strong> End up with a hand other than the one you were drawing to. For example, in seven-card stud, start with two pair on the first four cards and end up with a flush. Same as <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#38025">backdoor</a> (definition 1).

<div>
<p><strong><a name="14789"></a>backline</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Make an agreement between two or more players to accumulate chips by extracting a certain amount per hand or per bet from the winner’s pot and keeping the chips in a special area called the <em>backline</em>. For example, in a $10-limit game, if two players are backlining one chip per bet, and one of them wins a $100 pot (that is, the pot contains 10 bets), $10 goes on the backline. If they are backlining one chip per bet won, and both of them (only) are in the pot, only $5 goes on the backline (because the winner of the pot profited by $50, or five bets). At some prearranged time, the players split the backline. That is the point of this arrangement, that when one of the players is running bad, he makes some money off his “partner’s” good fortune. If the player who maintains the backline runs out of his own chips, there may be some argument about whether those chips are playable, or if the other player runs out of chips, he may want to get his share of the backline. For the reason that arguments sometimes arise from this sort of arrangement, many clubs do not permit backlining. In such clubs, some obstinate players do it anyway, but surreptitiously. It’s best when backlining that all parties involved in the agreement maintain sufficient chips to avoid running out in one pot or having to use the backline chips to bet with. A sharp tight player tries to make a backlining arrangement with a loose player. The loose player may lose money overall, but he wins more pots (because he plays more pots), and so the backline accumulates. The loose player doesn’t mind contributing when he’s winning, and when he’s losing, and his “partner” is lucky, he gets something from it. He just doesn’t realize that he’s taking the worst of it in yet another situation. Compare with <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#17255">save bets</a>.— (<em>n</em>) <strong>2.</strong> The chips accumulated by backlining. The name probably comes from where the chips are kept. The backline is usually a stack of chips behind a player’s own playing capital. Sometimes the backline is kept on the wooden rim, if the table has one.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#23315">California games</a>, multiple players may wager on the same hand. When a player bets on a hand and is not seated at that location at the table it is called <em>backline betting</em>. Backline bettors usually stand behind the seated player on whose hand they’re betting but they can also be seated at another seat location. Whoever wagers the most on a hand determines how to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#37958">set</a> (definition 3) the hand.</p>

<p><strong><a name="36383"></a>balanced games</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) The philosophy in some public cardroom that keeps two games of the same type at the same limit balanced with respect to the empty seats. Rather than one full game, and one short game, two games at the same limit would have the same number of empty seats. The rules that govern when and how players can move between such games vary from cardroom to cardroom. For example, if a cardroom has two 20-40 hold’em games, and 14 players, rather than seat nine players at one game and five at the other, the floor personnel ensure that the games stay at seven and seven. If one more player comes in, the games would become eight and seven. Whatever is considered the main game — sometimes the more desirable game in terms of action; sometimes the game that started first — gets the extra player when there are an odd number of players. The reason to have balanced games is so the cardroom doesn’t lose players who might not otherwise hang around to play in a short game. What often results is two short games full of disgruntled players. Compare with <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#36383">forced-move game</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) A variant of seven-card stud, played in home games only, in which 3s and 9s are wild. A player dealt a 3 face up must either <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5540#18007">match the pot</a> or fold. In some games, the player is not even offered the opportunity of folding; he <em>must</em> match the pot. Since the number 4 also has special significance in the “real” game of baseball, it also has special meaning in baseball. A player dealt a face-up 4 immediately receives another face-down card, to be used as an extra hole card. Sometimes (rarely) the game is played as five-card stud, in which case the player dealt a face-up 4 receives another face-up card.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>best flush</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A form of draw poker found only in home games, in which only flushes win. If there are more than one flush, the best one wins, exactly as if two or more flushes were competing in an ordinary game. If there is only one five-card flush, that hand wins.

<div>
<p><strong><a name="26813"></a>best-hand</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) A cheating technique, necessarily involving signals, in which only the best hand among two or more partners is played in any one pot, thereby saving the others money when that hand is beat, and reducing the difficulties of figuring out who gets how much at split time. For example, Slim and Shorty are playing best-hand in an <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#76569">ace-to-five lowball</a> game. Slim is under the gun with a pat 7-6-3-2-A, and is about to open, when he sees Shorty signaling that he has a pat 6-5-4-3-2. Slim very carefully discards his hand. (He does not throw the cards wildly into the discards; they might bounce and accidentally turn over. Slim would have a difficult time explaining to the other players why he wasn’t even opening the pot with such a good hand.) Shorty plays the hand, and likely wins it. If he loses, however, he doesn’t cause Slim also to lose money to the holder of the winning hand, thereby saving the cheating team half of what they would have lost. Best-hand is one of the most difficult scams to detect, because the players are not raising for each other, nor are they performing any physical manipulations upon the cards. Even with careful observation, best-hand could easily be confused with the legitimate situation of players staying out of each other’s way.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="14594"></a>best of it</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Advantage or edge.

</div>
<p>(<em>v</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Wager. “I bet.” — (<em>n</em>) <strong>2.</strong> The action required of a person whose turn it is to bet. “Whose bet is it?” <strong>3.</strong> A unit wager in a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#20487">limit game</a>. “It’s three bets up to you” means, if you come into the pot, you have to put in three betting units.” If you were in a $2-limit game, you would have to put $6 in the pot to play (or $8 — four bets — if you raised); If you were in a $200-limit game, you would have to put $600 in the pot to play.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>-bet</strong></p>
</div>

</div>
<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) Make a bet without looking at one’s cards. This occurs most frequently in lowball, in which a player draws one or more cards and, on the second round of betting, bets before receiving the card or cards. This is done usually for the purpose of stimulating action, but sometimes to discourage an opponent from raising. Sometimes players claim to bet blind but have actually seen their draw card or cards; doing this is considered bad form, and gives the claimant a bad reputation. The term is also heard in seven-card stud, with a player betting before receiving the river card, or in hold’em before the river card is dealt.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="71296"></a>bet blind-raise blind</strong></p>

<p><strong>Big Raise Hold’em</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A house-banked casino game dealt from one deck, in which players play separately against the dealer. The game is related to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#23406">hold’em</a> in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. Each player makes an ante bet and can also make a Big Raise bet of from one to three times the ante. This is done before receiving any cards. A further bet can be made to play against the bonus pay table; this bet wins when the player’s final hand is a pair of eights or better. Each player receives two hole cards and the dealer receives three cards &#8211; two face down and one face up. If the dealer’s upcard is an ace or a king, the player must go “all in,” risking both the ante and Big Raise. Otherwise, the player has a choice: risk the ante or the Big Raise bet (but not both), unless he has a pair, in which case he can risk both (go all in). After bets have been placed, the dealer then reveals his starting hand and deals three community cards, which then combine with the player’s hole cards to form the player’s five-card hand, and with the dealer’s three (if he started with an ace or king) or two hole cards to form the dealer’s best five-card hand. If the player’s hand beats the dealer’s, the player wins even money on the bet left in action, with ties pushing. Certain hands win payouts for the bonus bet, ranging from even money for a pair of eights to 50:1 for a royal flush. In addition, the ante and Big Raise bets always win 50:1 for a royal flush and 40:1 for a straight flush (in addition to the bonus payout). The game was invented by Shuffle Master, a company that makes automatic card-shuffling machines for casinos and cardrooms and devises new casino games.</p>

The manager says to the owner, “Did you see that bird dog Big George in here just now?” “Yeah, don’t mind seeing him in here when we’ve got a full house.” (The owner <em>would</em> mind if half the tables were empty, because he wouldn’t want that information to get back to the owner of the rival Garden Snake Club.) <strong>2.</strong> Someone who hustles players from one club into another.

<p><strong>bluff catcher</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> A hand with which a player feels he must call, even in a situation in which he is likely to lose. If a player stands pat in <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#20669">draw</a>, and you call with three aces, you can say, “I had a bluff catcher.” Some players (sometimes facetiously) refer to a good hand as a bluff catcher, often when they just call with the hand in preference to raising, probably because they’re afraid of being reraised. For example, in hold’em, aggressive Susie, behind a deep stack, bets the pot on the end with the board showing 4♦ 8♠ T♠ 6♦ Q♠. Tight John flat calls (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#39760">flat call</a>) her (that is, he does not raise) with the nut flush. Most players would consider that a raising hand, but a straight flush <em>is</em> possible. John does not want to be accused of playing tight, so he says, “I’ve got a bluff catcher,” as he shows down A♠ K♠. (And further reinforces his image. No one would call <em>him</em> with less than a big full house if he ever raised after the draw.) <strong>2.</strong> A medium-strength hand that can beat some bets but whose main strength is that it is likely (in the situation) better than only a bluff.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="67702"></a>bluffer</strong></p>

<p><strong><a name="93465"></a>Bonus Six</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A house-banked casino game dealt from one deck, in which players do not compete against the dealer. The game is related to poker in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. It has some similarities to stud games, in that a player starts with three cards and has the option, upon increasing his bet, of receiving more cards, or declining to bet and folding. To start the game, each player puts up an ante and an optional insurance fee. This insurance fee is half the size of the ante bet, and will not be returned or win anything; it only permits the player to receive an optional sixth card at the end (hence the name of the game). Each player receives two cards face down, and one community card is dealt face up. That community card becomes part of each player’s hand. Each player now has a three-card hand consisting of his two hole cards and that community card. Each player now decides whether to continue or fold. If a player folds, he forfeits his ante bet. If a player stays, he adds to his wager (raises) an amount equal to the ante. All players who raised receive a third hole card. Each player still in now has a four-card hand consisting of his three hole cards and the one community card. Each player again decides whether to continue or fold. If the player folds, he forfeits both his ante and the second bet. If a player stays, he again raises an amount equal to the ante. All players who raised receive a fourth hole card. Each player still in now has a five-card hand consisting of his four hole cards and the community card. If a player initially purchased insurance and does not have a paying hand at this point, he has the option of buying a sixth card, at a cost equal to the ante. The fee for the sixth card is never returned. That is, this fee is not a bet or part of the total wager and, just like the original insurance cost, is not returned and wins nothing. If the player buys a sixth card, he can then make the best five-card hand among his six cards (his five hole cards plus the one community card). A player still in who did not pay insurance forms a five-card from the combination of his four hole cards plus the community card. The dealer then pays off each winning hand. The ante is first paid 1:1 for a hand of a pair of 6s or better. In addition, the three total bets are paid off as follows: royal flush, 1,000:1 (1,000 times the amount of the three bets); straight flush, 100:1; four of a kind, 50:1; full house, 20:1; flush, 6:1; straight, 4:1; three of a kind, 3:1; two pair, 2:1; pair of 6s or better, 1:1.</p>

<p><strong>Boston 5 stud</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A house-banked casino game dealt from one deck, in which players play separately against the dealer. The game is related to poker in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. To start the game, each player puts up an ante and a first wager. The first wager amount is twice that of the ante. Each player can also make an optional bonus bet; a player must play the main game to make a bonus bet. Each player and the dealer receives three cards face down. After players see their cards, they must either fold or place a second wager equal to the first wager. Any player with a three-card bonus hand must place the hand face up on the table prior to receiving the final two cards, so the dealer can award the bonus. Players who made a second wager receive their two final cards dealt face down. Each hand in which the player has paid for all five cards is individually compared to the dealer’s five-card hand, and the higher hand wins. If the player’s hand beats the dealer’s hand, the player wins even money on the first and second wagers, and the ante pushes. If the dealer’s hand beats the player’s hand, the player loses all wagers. If the player’s hand and dealer’s are equal in value, all wagers push. Regardless of whether the player or dealer has the higher hand, the player wins a bonus for hands of two pair or greater, based on the ante bet. If the player has a bonus hand but loses to the dealer, he still gets the bonus but loses the ante bet. Bonuses are paid as follows: The three-card bonus bet pays for a three-card straight flush, 40-1; three of a kind, 30-1; straight, 6-1; flush, 4-1; pair, 1-1. The ante bonus pays: for a royal flush, 1,000:1; straight flush, 200:1; four of a kind, 100:1; full house, 25:1; flush, 15:1; straight, 10:1; three of a kind, 5:1; two pair, 2:1.</p>

If he had opened the pot, he might be breaking or splitting openers (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#39311">split openers</a>). <strong>5.</strong> Remove some chips from your stack, usually followed by [<em>one’s</em>] <em>stack</em> or <em>chips</em>. In some clubs, if you <em>break your stack</em> when it is your time to bet, that is considered a bet, and you must follow through, that is, complete the bet. This is to prevent an <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#42262">angle shooter</a> from putting chips into the pot to gauge another’s reaction and then withdrawing the chips without betting; in some clubs a bet is not considered complete until the player has released the chips from his hand. — (<em>vi</em>) <strong>6.</strong> In lowball, to draw. (The implication is that if circumstances were different the player could stand pat on the hand.) “You don’t need any cards? Okay, I’ll break.” — (<em>n</em>) <strong>7.</strong> A stop in play or time out of a game. “If I don’t take a break I’m going to go on tilt.” <strong>8.</strong> In a tournament, time between rounds when play halts and players can take a bathroom, smoking, or food break. “There will be a dinner break after the completion of the first three rounds, plus two shorter bathroom breaks.” <strong>9.</strong> Time taken by a house dealer between downs. (See <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#42077">down</a>, definition 6.) “How long before this dealer gets a break? He’s killing me!”</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> In a tournament, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#42918">break a game</a>, to even other tables or the overall distribution; usually followed by <em>a game</em> or <em>a table</em>. <strong>2.</strong> Change larger denomination chips for smaller ones.

<div>
<p><strong>break for action</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) In lowball, throw away part of a good hand to get a play from someone who would otherwise fold. “Come on, call the raise, and I’ll break for action.” The preceding might be heard in a no-limit lowball game in the following situation. One player has raised. The opener does not want to call because he needs two cards, which is not a good gamble against what might well be a pat hand. The raiser wants a call from the other because he has the potential of winning a very large pot as opposed to just a small pot if the other folds, so he tries to entice the opener, implying that if the opener draws two, he will break his pat hand and draw one. (The <em>implication</em> is only that he has a pat hand, not that he will draw. Once a player offers this sort of <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#36805">proposition</a>, it is not proper cardroom etiquette to renege on it. While most cardrooms do not enforce propositions, the other players will consider a player who offers a proposition and does not follow through a poor sport and not believe him when he has a legitimate offer, nor will they ever give him any <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#38420">action</a>.)</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>v</em>) Give a thief a secret sign to leave; usually <em>brush someone off</em>. This is usually done by a houseman who privately (in such a way as not to embarrass the thief and not to alert the unknowing customers that some of the patrons may not be strictly on the up-and-up) requests a player to leave. The request is often in the form of a finger run unobtrusively up the offender’s spine. It can be a literal brushing motion (hence the name) of one hand down the other arm, starting below the elbow, across the other hand, which is palm down, to the fingertips. It can also be a brushing motion of one hand across the upper lip.</p>

The brush person talks to casino patrons who may be lingering on the edge of the cardroom area, perhaps wondering what is going on and maybe needing only a bit of explanation or other coercion to actually sit down in a game. “Are you a poker player? Oh, just home games? Well, feel free to watch our games, and ask me if you have any questions.” “Oh, you do play? But you haven’t played here? What do you usually play? Oh, seven stud? We have several seven stud games, with limits from 2/4 all the way up to 300/600. What size game were you interested in?” The name <em>brush</em> comes from the employee’s job, when no prospective players are in sight, of brushing off a table that has just become empty, that is, cleaning the table up for the next game.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> A marker used in games with a house dealer to indicate the deal position. Once upon a time, an actual buck knife (one with a buckhorn handle) was used as the marker, hence the name. Usually found now as part of the phrase <em>pass the buck</em>, that is, refuse to deal when it is one’s turn to deal, passing the deck instead to the next player to the left. The expression has moved from the world of poker to general usage in the English language meaning shift responsibility to someone else, and has found a place in most collections of famous quotations and sayings with Harry Truman’s well-known slogan, “The buck stops here.” <strong>2.</strong> $1 or a $1 chip. “Cost ya a buck.” <strong>—</strong> (<em>vt</em>) <strong>3.</strong> Go up against [(usually) a better hand], in the sense of an inferior hand trying to beat an obviously better hand. For example, a player who has, in seven-card stud, only a pair of jacks, playing against someone with an exposed pair of aces, is said to be in the process of <em>bucking the aces</em>. The term is also found as part of the phrase <em>buck the odds</em>. See also <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#40110">chase</a>, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5561#38888">worst of it</a>.</p>

<div>
<p><strong><a name="12454"></a>bug</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> The <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5534#29411">joker</a> when used as a “partially wild card” in high draw poker and <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#37159">ace-to-five</a> lowball. In high, it is good for aces, straights, and flushes. It makes a third (or fourth) ace, but does not improve any other pair. In a deck with the bug, a rank of hand exists higher than any straight flush: five aces. Examples: Two aces, two 3s, and the bug make a full house, aces full of 3s. Two kings, two 3s, and the bug make two pair, kings and 3s, with an ace kicker. 3♣ 4♠ 6♦ 7♦ plus the bug makes a 7-high straight, with the bug representing a 5. 4♣ 5♠ 6♦ 7♦ plus the bug makes an 8-high straight, with the bug representing an 8. With four to a flush plus the bug, the bug always makes the flush as good as it could be. In 5♦ 7♦ J♦ Q♦ plus the bug, the bug is the A♦, and makes an ace-queen flush, <em>even if someone else has the “real” ace of diamonds</em>. (In fact, it is possible for two players both to have ace-high flushes in the same suit, something not possible in a deck with no wild cards.) If the flush already has an ace, the bug becomes the next lowest card. In A♥ 9♥ 7♥ 2♥ plus the bug, the bug is the K♥. In A♠ K♠ Q♠ 2♠ plus the bug, the bug is the J♠. In 9♦ T♦ J♦ Q♦ plus the bug, the bug is the K♦, and makes a king-high straight flush. In<a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#76569">ace-to-five lowball</a>, the bug is the lowest unmatched card in a hand, as shown by these two examples: In 6♠ 5♥ 3♦ 2♦ plus the bug, the bug is an ace. In 4♥ 3♥ 2♦ A♣ plus the bug, the bug is a 5. Also see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#22358">double-ace flush</a>. In the high use, sometimes called <em>snoozer</em>. <strong>2.</strong> A <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#27981">cheating device</a> to hold a card to the underside of a table. Compare with <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#40698">clip</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="86452"></a>Burns-Landrum estimate</strong></p>
</div>
<p><em>n phrase</em>) A means of chopping (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#43560">chop</a>, definition 3) among finalists in a tournament. The method is not strictly accurate, allotting more to small stacks and less to large stacks than perhaps is warranted, but fits into a convenient formula. Here is an example: Assume that your stack size relative to the total chips in play represents your chance of taking first. If you don’t take first, assign equal probabilities to finishing in all other places. The second part is a simplification that’s known to be inaccurate, but since most tournament payout structures are very top-heavy, it’s not a horrible approximation. Here’s the math: Let <em>n</em> be the number of players remaining (including you). Let <em>C</em> be the total chips in play. Let <em>S</em> be your stack size. Let <em>P1</em> be the payout for first place, <em>P2</em> the payout for second, etc. Let <em>Pr</em> be the sum of (<em>P2</em>, <em>P3</em>, &#8230;<em>Pn</em>) (in other words, the remaining prize pool excluding first place). Then your estimated equity in the tournament is:</p>
<p>((S/C)*P1) + (((C-S)/C)* (Pr/(n-1)))</p>
<p>Using the figures shown in the example under <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#85628">by the chips method</a>, the division with Burns-Landrum would be: A, $67.5, B, $57.5, C, $50. This method assumes equal skill among players. This assumption is obviously false in real tournament situations, but the estimation of your equity is useful to know for starting negotiation.

<p><strong>buy the button</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Act upon the rule, observed mainly in Northern California cardrooms in games played with blinds, in which a new player sitting down with the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#21700">button</a> (definition 1) to his right (who would normally be required to sit out one hand and let the button pass him, then <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#30523">post</a> to receive a hand) may choose to pay the amount of both blinds for this one hand (the amount of the big blind playing as a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#28638">live blind</a>, and the amount of the small blind as a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#11922">dead blind</a>), play the current hand, and then receive the button on the next hand as if he had been playing all along.

On his deal, they post their blinds exactly as they would have had he been there for the previous hand. <strong>2.</strong> Make a raise from the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#23363">cutoff seat</a> to try to force the button to fold, thus giving the raiser last position in subsequent betting rounds.</p>

<div>
<p><strong><a name="85628"></a>by the chips method</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A means of chopping (see <a href="/Documents/Web/Web%20development/Poker1/Poker1%20(new,%20WordPress)/Dictionary%20(files%20from%20MW%202010-06-07)/2006/vocabc.htm#22912"></a>, definition 3) among finalists in a tournament. Also known as “chip chop figures.” Here is an example. All players involved in the deal are initially assigned a payout equal to that of the smallest regular payout yet to be awarded. The remaining prize money is then distributed in direct proportion to the players’ fraction of chips in the tournament. So, if three players remained in a tournament with scheduled prizes of:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1st</td>
<td>$100</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2nd</td>
<td>$50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3rd</td>
<td>$25</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And the players had these chip stacks:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>1200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>800</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>500</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each player would receive $25 (third place), leaving $100 in the prize pool, so the chip chop figures would be:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>$25 + (1200/2500) x $100 = $73</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>$25 + (800/2500) x $100 = $57</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>$25 + (500/2500) x $100 = $45</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In addition to this, in any deal it is also possible to set any amount aside for the eventual winner. This amount is then deducted from the prize pool before any calculations are made. For example, if $25 were left on the table, the division would be: A, $61, B, $49, C, $40. In such a deal, C could potentially make more than B by going on, after the deal was made, to win the tournament. This is the method many floorpeople will suggest when you ask them what a fair deal would be. Compare with <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#86452">Burns-Landrum estimate</a>.</p>
