<p><strong><a name="13271"></a>expectation</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> The average profit or loss of a particular bet, in the long run. Also called <em>return</em>. Example: In no-limit hold’em with blinds of $5 and $10, the pot contains $400 on the turn, of which you have put in $150. You have been calling all the way with K♦ Q♦. The board reads A♦ 9♦ T♥ 7♥. An opponent goes all in for $200, and the bet is to you. You call and the K♣ comes, and your hand loses to the bettor’s A♥ 9♠. Your having lost this particular pot is immaterial to your <em>expectation</em> on calling the $200 bet. You can figure this out exactly for this situation once you see the other player’s cards. You are getting <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5508#40256">effective odds</a>here of 400-to-200, or 2-to-1. You would have won with any diamond or any of the three remaining jacks (the J♦ is one of the already counted diamonds), 12 Of the 44 unseen cards, that is, 12 cards beat the opponent’s two pair, and 32 don’t. Nearly 3/4 of the time (72.72 percent of the time) you lose this bet, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t call the bet. In every 100 times that this situation comes up, 72.72 times you lose your $200 call; that comes to $14545.45. In every 100 times, 27.27 times you win $600; that comes to $16363.64. Your net profit for the 100 times is $1818.19. Divide that by 100 to find the expectation for each call. That comes to $18.18. Your expectation, then, on the $200 call is $18.18. Had you folded, you would have lost $150. The average difference in this exact situation between folding and calling the raise is a $168.18 <em>positive expectation</em>. The reason we don’t say that your expectation on the play is only $18.18 is that in some situations you expect to lose money overall, but you lose less by calling than by folding and abandoning what you have already put into the pot. In situations that result in a net loss, you have a <em>negative expectation</em>. (The calculations neglected the cards in the hands of the players who folded. If you do not see those cards, you cannot take them into account for the calculation. Sometimes they worsen your expectation; sometimes they improve it.) <strong>2.</strong> Average hourly winnings (for a winning player, or losses, for a losing player), calculated by adding up your winnings over a time long enough to eliminate short-term statistical aberrations and dividing that by the number of hours played. For example, in 1,000 hours of play, your meticulously kept books show that you won $17,853; your expectation is $17.85 per hour. If you continue to play in the same games and limits, you can reasonably expect that expectation to continue. Of course, you may have some hours in which you lose hundreds of dollars, and others in which you win that much, but over the long run it should average out.

<p><strong><a name="21003"></a>expected value</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5508#13271">Expectation</a> (definition 1) expressed as a dollar amount. For example, if your chance of winning a $100 pot is 50 percent, your expected value in that pot is $50. Also, <em>equity</em>. Sometimes shortened to <em>EV</em>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>experienced player</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) One who has played a lot of poker, probably for many years. Since experience does not necessarily equate to skill, this term is not synonymous with <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5508#32647">expert player</a>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="32647"></a>expert player</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) An experienced player whose superior skills give him a winning <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5508#13271">expectation</a> (definition 2) against most opponents; <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#27352">professional player</a>.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>expose</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v</em>) Partially or completely reveal one or more cards to one or more players.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>exposed card</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Any card dealt face up, as any of the upcards in a stud game. <strong>2.</strong> A card that inadvertently appears face up during the deal in a draw game, or that gets accidentally turned face up. Cardrooms have various rules for dealing with such accidental exposures, such as ruling the card <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#22815">dead</a> (that is, not legally playable), dead at some times but not others, perhaps signaling a misdeal, and so on. For example, in draw poker (high), an exposed card during the initial deal is often not declared dead, but is dead at any time during the draw. In <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#76569">ace-to-five lowball</a>, during the initial deal, sometimes any exposed card 6 or higher is declared dead (and replaced with another card, usually after all the other cards have been dealt out), but any card A through 5 can be kept by the player to whom it is dealt; during the draw, usually <em>any</em> exposed card is deemed dead. In stud and flop games (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#94859">flop game</a>), downcards inadvertently exposed by the dealer are usually ruled dead.</p>
<div>
<p><strong></a>exposed pair</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In stud games, any open or visible pair, as opposed to a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#21034">hidden pair</a>; two cards of the same rank in the face-up position in one player’s hand.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="25009"></a>extra outs</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) Cards that improve a hand in more ways than the self-evident <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5544#39800">outs</a>. Both terms (<em>outs</em> and <em>extra outs</em>) are usually used with reference to a hand that needs to improve to win the pot (because it is currently beat by some other hand). For example, in seven-card stud, on <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#43515">sixth street</a> you have A♥ K♥ 7♥ 5♥ 4♣ 3♦, while another player has J♦ J♠ Q♣ Q♥ 9♥ 10♦, two pair. You can’t win unless you improve, which you see as making the flush, so you count the remaining hearts as the number of <em>outs</em> you have. Perhaps you didn’t notice that you can also make an inside straight, by catching any 6. This gives you four<em>extra outs</em>. If you make the flush, your opponent needs to make a full house to win; if you make the straight, he can win with a full house, but he, too, has <em>extra outs</em>, because any 8 or K makes him a higher straight.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="25961"></a>extra bet</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A bet or raise that forces a player to call one more bet to continue in a hand. “He managed to get an extra bet in every round.”</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Extra Plus</a></strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) See <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#91824">casino stud poker</a>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="20713"></a>eyes</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) In hold’em, a pair of aces, particularly when they constitute a player’s starting cards. May come from <em>snake eyes</em> in dice, one pip on each die. Also called <em>eyes of Texas</em>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>eyes of Texas</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5508#20713">Eyes</a>. Comes from the song of the same name.</p>
