<p><strong>flop percent</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) The percentage of players who stay for a flop. While such a figure can be calculated for any specific table, it is usually used only in online cardrooms (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5544#57086">online cardroom</a>), generally available in the list of tables. This is because the software can easily make the calculation, while in a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#36827">brick and mortar cardroom</a> it would only be an estimate.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Flop Poker</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A house-banked card game that uses poker hand rankings, in which players do not compete against the dealer. The game is related to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#23406">hold’em</a> in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. The object of the game is to make a poker hand containing a pair of jacks or better using the player’s three cards dealt and the three community cards turned up by the dealer. In addition, players can bet that their hand will be the best of all hands dealt. Each player places two bets, an <em>ante</em> bet and a <em>pot</em> bet. The ante wager can be any amount up to the table limit. The pot bet is always the table minimum. Three cards are dealt to each player face down. The player may look at his own cards but sharing of information is not allowed. The player has two options, raise or fold. If the player folds, he forfeits his ante but retains his cards for later settling of the pot bet. If the player raises, he does so by making a <em>flop</em> bet equal to his ante bet. The dealer then deals a three-card flop face up. These are community cards and are used by all players. The dealer determines in turn each player’s best poker hand using all three of the player cards in combination with any two of the flop cards. If the player has at least a pair of jacks, the ante wager pays even money and the flop wager pays all winners according to a pay table, ranging from even money on a pair of jacks or better to 1,000:1 for a royal flush. Finally, the player with the highest poker hand, again using his own three cards and any two flop cards, wins all pot bets. If two or more hands are tied, the pot bets are split among the players holding those hands. Like the odds bet of craps, the <em>pot</em> bet of Flop Poker has absolutely no house advantage. That is, it pays <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#42268">correct odds</a> (definition 1).</p>

In high poker, this hand ranks above a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#25677">straight</a> and below a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#19236">full house</a>. A flush is often specified by its top one or two cards. For example, A♠ K♠ 9♠ 4♠ 2♠ is called an <em>ace-king flush</em>. Five cards of the same suit in sequence constitutes a hand known as a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#12516">straight flush</a>. Unlike the game of bridge, suits do not count; two flushes with all five cards duplicated would split the pot at the showdown. That is, A♥ K♥ 9♥ 4♥ 2♥ ranks the same as the preceding. Five cards of the same suit in sequence constitutes a hand known as a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#12516">straight flush</a>.

Whoever wins two pots in a row gets the kitty. This tends to stimulate action, because when a player wins a pot, she is likely to loosen her requirements for the next pot to try to get the kitty. She may kill the next pot to try to increase her chances of winning the next pot and to keep out the two-card draws. Also, <em>after the rabbit</em>, and sometimes shortened to just <em>rabbit.</em></p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> A mandatory bet on the first round of play in a stud game. For example, in seven-card stud, the lowest card dealt on the first round might have to make a <em>forced bet</em>, usually of a smaller amount than the normal betting limit. In a $2-$4 game, the lowest card might have to bet 50 cents. Subsequent bettors may either call, or raise by $2 (sometimes only to $2, that is, a raise of $1.50). In most home games, the forced bet is made by the highest exposed card in high games, and by the lowest exposed card in low games. If two cards of the same rank appear, the one closest to the left of the dealer must make the forced bet. In cardrooms, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#19946">bridge order</a> (or <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#77608">reverse bridge order</a>) is sometimes used. <strong>2.</strong> A requirement, generally found only in home games, that the first player with <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#38420">action</a> (definition 2), usually the player to the left of the dealer, or, in a game with blinds, to the left of the big blind, must come into the pot, that is, cannot fold. <strong>3.</strong> Any bet that must be made prior to the deal of a hand, such as an ante or blind.</p>

As seats become available in the main game, players in the <em>forced-move game</em> must move to the main game. The reason to have forced-move games is to make sure that the main game is always full, as opposed to the balanced-game (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#36383">balanced games</a>) situation in which two tables might both have vacancies, and yet no one is permitted to change games.

<p><strong><a name="88131"></a>four-card poker</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A house-banked game, which resembles poker only in the ranking of the hands, dealt from one deck, similar to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#23524">three-card poker</a>. Each player receives five cards from which to make four-card poker hands (with four-card straights and four-card flushes as ranking hands, and hands ranked thus: four of a kind, straight flush, three of a kind, flush, straight, two pair, pair); only the best four cards in each hand are used to determine winners. The dealer gets six cards to make a four-card hand; one of the dealer’s cards is dealt face up. Two bets can be made. For the original bet (the ante), a player is paid, if he stays, on certain holdings according to a pay scale, ranging from 2:1 for three of a kind to 25:1 for four of a kind. After seeing his hand, a player can either fold or stay in the game by making a second bet (the Aces Up bet), and then his hand competes against the dealer’s; the player wins ties. This second bet can be equal to, twice, or three times the ante. If the player does not make the Aces Up bet, he loses the original bet. Unlike three-card poker, the dealer does not need to qualify. Some casinos have other rules, sometimes involving three bets. The Aces Up bet wins when the player has a pair of aces or better, ranging from even money for a pair of aces to 50:1 for four of a kind. The game was invented by Shuffle Master, a company that makes automatic card-shuffling machines for casinos and cardrooms and devises new casino games.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) An extremely lucky draw, usually greatly defying probability, and often in such a way as to defeat a hand that has considerably the best of it. If, in <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#76569">ace-to-five lowball</a>, you draw three cards and make a 6 or better, that constitutes a <em>freak draw</em>.

<div>
<p><strong><a name="34036"></a>free card</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In stud poker or hold’em, the situation in which there is no bet on a particular round, so players get extra cards without having had to risk additional money. In hold’em, for example, you are on the button with A♠ Q♠. The flop is 2♠ 7♠ J♦, giving you four to the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5542#31413">nut flush</a>. An early player bets, and there are a few calls. You raise, and all call. No matter the turn card, the other players may check to you. If another spade doesn’t come, you can check also, thus saving a bet at the higher limit, and allowing you to see the river card for “free.”</p>
<div>
<p><strong>free hand</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) Some clubs let a new player (new to the particular game) be dealt in immediately upon sitting down, rather than having to wait until it is his turn to put in the big blind. (In many clubs, one must either <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5561#59241">wait for the blind</a> or <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#30523">post</a>.) Each time he receives cards before the blind gets to him is a <em>free hand</em>. Presumably a player could play a few hands and get up without ever having had to put in a blind. In practice, this rarely happens, so it all evens out.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="13616"></a>free look</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In draw poker or lowball, a player has looked at the first four of his cards, and the remaining one, which he presumably has not seen, is the <em>free look</em>. (I say “presumably” because some players seem to have a free look every hand, and yet they always look at the first four dealt them in the order dealt.) You might in lowball hear a player say, “I’ve got a free look, and I’m gonna raise it.” That gives others the impression that the player has raised without seeing the fifth card, but hardly anyone ever believes that.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>free peek</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#13616">Free look</a>. “How come the free peek is always in the last position?”</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="10787"></a>free ride</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> In stud poker or hold’em, a betting round in which no one bets, which permits the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#11970">active</a> players to receive (or see) a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#34036">free card</a>. Also, in flop games (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#94859">flop game</a>), the situation in which all players have limped preflop and the big blind can play without having to put extra money into the pot. By extension to draw, this would be the situation in a double-limit blind game with a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5528#41327">gypsy</a> (permitting players to open for a bet equal to the size of the blind) in which players opened for the minimum and the blind gets to draw without putting any extra money in the pot. <strong>2.</strong> In <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#19218">pass-and-back-in</a> draw poker, an opening round in which no one opens, thus allowing every player to draw without having to make a bet.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="30524"></a>freeroll</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> In hold’em, the situation in which one player can win the entire pot when guaranteed half the pot because he is currently tied with another player. For example, you have A♥ J♥ and your opponent has A♦ J♦. The flop is J♠ 5♥ T♥. You are tied with the other player, each having a pair of jacks with the same kickers. You have a <em>freeroll</em> (also, you are <em>freerolling</em>), since you can win the whole pot and he can’t. If any card but a heart comes in the next two cards, you split the pot with the other player, but with any heart, you win the whole pot. Also called <em>freeroll hand</em>. <strong>2.</strong> <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#15528">Freeroll tournament</a>. — (<em>v</em>) <strong>3. </strong>To be in the situation described in definition 1. <strong>4. </strong>Play in a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#15528">freeroll tournament</a>. “The site offers a chance to freeroll for a WSOP seat.”</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> A tournament in which players start with a specified amount and then can buy no further chips; once they lose their chips, they are out, as opposed to a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#28550">rebuy tournament</a>. The tournament continues until one player has all the chips. As players are eliminated, they may receive prizes based on the order of their elimination. For example, the final remaining player may win 50 percent of the prize pool, the next-to-last 25 percent, the third 10 percent, and so on. Also called <em>no-rebuy tournament</em>.

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) The <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#23344">deck</a> of cards used by the French, who have been designing and manufacturing playing cards since at least the 15th Century, when they assigned to each of the court cards names taken from history or mythology. These designs appear often somewhat different in design in the <em>English deck</em>. In the French deck, the face cards had specific meaning, whereas in the English deck, card historians generally accept that they do not. Confusion lies in the fact that the suits in the English deck came from the French deck.</p>

<p><strong><a name="19701"></a>full bet</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> In a limit game, a bet as large as the current limit. For example, in a $10-$20 game, in the $10 round or rounds, $10 is a full bet, and anything less is not. Cardrooms have different interpretations as to whether anything less than a full bet can be raised or whether a player is even permitted to bet less, and if an <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#31254">all-in</a> player bets less, whether succeeding players can call that amount or must themselves put in a full bet. <strong>2.</strong> In a no-limit, pot-limit, or spread-limit game, a bet as large as the minimum for the table, with similar discussion as the preceding. <strong>3.</strong> In a no-limit, pot-limit, or spread-limit game, a bet as large as the preceding bet. For example, if Emilie bets $50 and John can call only $30 of that, he would be said not to have a full bet. In this sense, the term <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#17946">short</a> or <em>short bet</em> is often used. For definitions 1 and 2, also see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#23158">complete the bet</a>, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#25818">half a bet</a>, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#41521">legal raise</a>. In some cardrooms, a raise of half a bet is considered to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#38180">reopen the betting</a>; in others, only a full bet does so. The rule covering all of these situations is known as the <em>full-bet rule</em>.</p>
