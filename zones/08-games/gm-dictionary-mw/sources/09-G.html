<p><strong><a name="82311"></a>game theory</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) Betting or calling in a certain way when you don’t know how an opponent plays so as to prevent the opponent from obtaining an edge by his own betting or calling. Against an opponent whose play you are familiar with, you bluff, for example, more or less often depending on what you know of his calling habits. Against one whose habits you don’t know, though, you use <em>game theory</em>. For example, if there are five bets in the pot and you have a hand that can win only by bluffing, if you can get away with a (one-bet) bluff more than one-fifth of the time, you profit by this use of game theory. Or, against one player, if, on the end, you have a hand that can beat only a bluff, you figure the player would bluff in this situation 10 percent of the time, and the pot, including his bet, offers 9-to-1 or better, you call. Game theory in poker is often of less importance than pattern detection, recognition of tells, knowledge of the opponent, and so on.

<p><strong>gap concept</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) The idea that it takes a stronger hand to call a raise preflop (or before the draw in draw poker) than it does to make the original raise. Arising out of this is that the range of reraising hands shrinks. For example, in hold’em you might come in for a raise in the cutoff seat with A-T, but if the pot has already been raised when it gets to you, you might not even call. The term was originally coined by poker theoretician David Sklansky.</p>

<p><strong><a name="54692"></a>Golden Oasis Poker</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A house-banked game popular in Russian casinos that bears some resemblance to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#17249">Caribbean Stud Poker</a> and <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#56056">Caribbean Draw Poker</a>. (The game is related to poker in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game.) The difference is that players can replace from 1 to 5 cards, at a cost of 1 ante for 1 or 5 cards, and 2 antes for 2, 3, or 4. The payouts are the same as Caribbean Stud, and the dealer must qualify with ace-king or better. The game has an optional jackpot bet, based on the player’s first five cards, with payouts starting at a flush per a payback table. An added option is that at the end if the dealer doesn’t qualify, the player can “buy the game” for the dealer, by paying an extra ante bet, in which case the dealer replaces the highest one of his cards. If after the exchange the dealer’s hand still does not qualify, that ante bet is lost.</p>

<p><strong>gravy</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Unexpected profit on a hand. For example, in a no-limit hold’em game one player has only $20 and is all in. You have created a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#38874">side pot</a> of $200 by raising another player. You and the other player both have money left on the river. You were betting all along on a draw, which you missed entirely. The player with remaining chips checks, you bet $200 on what is now a pure bluff, and he folds. You know that the side pot is all yours, already a profit of $180, but you think that the $60 <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5540#32500">main pot</a> probably will belong to the all-in player, however, on the showdown he cannot beat your hand, because he also had a draw and missed worse than you did. That $60 is <em>gravy</em>. Or, you bet with the nuts, expecting one caller, but instead get three. The extra money you win is gravy. <strong>2.</strong> The amount by which a player is ahead, usually implying that he is in a lot and was stuck until fairly recently. “Boy, <em>you’re</em> winning a lot! Look at all those chips — must be over a grand.” “Uh huh. I’m <em>in</em> a thousand. There’s $1040 here, so $40 is gravy.”</p>

<div>
<p><strong><a name="45355"></a>guaranteed tournament</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A tournament that offers a guaranteed prize pool or guaranteed first-place prize. If fewer players participate than sufficient to build the prize pool to the guarantee amount, the house must pay the difference. This produces a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#25140">buy-in overlay</a> for the players. That is, the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5508#21003">expected value</a> for the average player is higher than the cost of the buy-in. Such a tournament is offered to attract participation. In most cases, if the casino accurately predicts attendance, the prize pool is larger than the guarantee, but sometimes a casino puts more into a tournament than it makes (in the form of entry fees). For example, a casino might advertise a particular tournament (often one with a buy-in of at least $5,000) as a $1,000,000-guaranteed tournament. In the case of a $5,000 tournament with a $100 entry fee, 196 participants are needed for the casino to break almost even.</p>

<p><strong><a name="41327"></a>gypsy</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v, n</em>) See <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5528#31499">gypsying in</a>. This term is often used in the negative, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5542#34823">no gypsy</a>, meaning that the minimum open is always two bets.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="31499"></a>gypsying in</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) In the smaller <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#41512">double-limit</a> games and generally referring to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5534#11165">jacks or better</a> draw or <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#76569">ace-to-five lowball</a>, usually up to $15-$30, a pot can be opened for the minimum bet. This is called <em>gypsying in</em>. It’s an old term that is becoming obsolete. Particularly in flop games (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#94859">flop game</a>), the term <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#35532">limp</a> is usually heard. For example, in the 2-4 game (as it used to be played in Southern California), the dealer puts a dollar chip in the pot before the cards have been dealt, the player to the left of the dealer also puts in a dollar chip before the cards have been dealt, and the player two positions to the left of the dealer puts in two dollar chips. After the cards have been dealt, the players look at their cards. Starting three positions to the left of the dealer, each player makes a decision in turn whether to play the pot. If a player does not want to play, the player discards his or her cards, and has no further interest in this pot. The first player to put money into the pot after having seen his or her cards is said to <em>open the pot</em>, or, simply, to <em>open</em>. That player has two choices on the opening bet. He can open for $2, that is, the size of the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#26108">big blind</a>. Or he can open for $4, which is called <em>coming in for a raise</em> (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#10270">come in for a raise</a>). Opening for the minimum permitted is called <em>gypsying in</em>. If a player opens for $2, any succeeding player can fold, call the $2 bet, or raise to $4. Similarly, if a player opens for $4, any succeeding player can fold, call the $4 bet, or raise to $6. After the first raise, further raises proceed in $2 increments. If the pot is opened for the minimum, and no one raises, when the betting gets to the dealer or middle blind, either of them can call for just $1. And, when the betting gets to the big blind, the big blind can stop the betting, or raise it. This kind of blind is called a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#28638">live blind</a>. When the big blind elects not to raise a minimum opening bet, the player usually signifies by tapping his or her cards on the table, or saying something like, “Deal ’em,” signifying that it’s time to draw cards, because the first-round betting action is over. In another example, in the 15-30 game, the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#41450">dealer blind</a> is $5, the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5540#31069">middle blind</a> is $10, and the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#26108">big blind</a> is $15. As in the previous example, the first player to put money into the pot after having seen his or her cards has two choices on the opening bet. He can open for $15, that is, the size of the big blind. This is <em>gypsying in</em>. Or he can open for $30, that is, <em>come in for a raise</em>. As in the smaller game, if a player opens for $15, any succeeding player can fold, call the $15 bet, or raise it to $30. Similarly, if a player opens for $30, any succeeding player can fold, call the $30 bet, or raise it to $45. After the first raise, further raises proceed in $15 increments. If the pot is opened for the minimum, and no one raises, when the betting gets to the dealer, that player can call for $10, while the middle blind can call for $5. (Of course, either has the option of folding, or raising.) And, when the betting gets to the big blind, the big blind can stop the betting (or close it; see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#38371">close the action</a> and <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5544#78105">option</a>, definition 1), or raise. Games in which gypsying in is not permitted are called<em>no gypsy</em>.</p>
