<p><strong><a name="25818"></a>half a bet</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> A bet equal to half the limit. Such a bet has significance only when a player has no more chips left than those with which to raise or call, in which case some establishments recognize it as a legitimate bet that can be reraised (on the side). For example, in some clubs, in, say, a $4-limit game, if I open the pot, and a few players call, and one player has $6 left, he can raise the pot. I can reraise, but to do so I need to put in two more full bets, that is, not a further $6, but a further $8. Some establishments do not even permit a player to call if he has less than a full bet. (He can play the hand through, but gets no action on his few remaining chips.) Also see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#19701">full bet</a>, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#41521">legal raise</a>. <strong>2.</strong> In a limit game, a bet half as large as the current limit. For example, in a $10-$20 game, in the $10 round or rounds, $10 is a full bet, and $5 is considered a half bet. Cardrooms have different interpretations as to whether anything less than a full bet can be raised or whether a player is even permitted to bet less, and if an <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#31254">all-in</a> player bets less, whether succeeding players can call that amount or must themselves put in a full bet. Some cardrooms allow a half bet to be raised by a full bet. <strong>3.</strong> In a no-limit, pot-limit, or spread-limit game, a bet half as large as the minimum for the table, with similar discussion as the preceding. <strong>4.</strong> In a no-limit, pot-limit, or spread-limit game, a bet half as large as the preceding bet. For example, if Emilie bets $50 and John can call only $25 of that, he would be said to have called half a bet. In some cardrooms, a raise of half a bet is considered to<a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#38180">reopen the betting</a>; in others, only a full bet does so. The rule covering all of these situations is known as the <em>half-bet rule</em>.

<p><strong><a name="93435"></a>hand</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> The cards in the possession of a player. In <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#23406">hold’em</a>, a hand is the player’s two hole cards; in <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#24570">pineapple</a>, three cards; in <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5544#27642">Omaha</a>, four cards; in <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#23024">draw poker</a>, five cards; in <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#15112">seven-card stud</a>, as many cards as a particular player currently is in possession of, right up to seven at the end. <strong>2.</strong> The cards in the possession of a player at the end of play of a hand. In hold’em, that hand is the player’s two cards plus whatever portion of the board constitutes his best five-card holding. For example, if a player holds K♥ 10♥ and the board is 9♠ 8♣ 7♥ 6♠ 3♥, his hand is a 10-high straight. Here, the 10♥ and the 3♥ are not considered part of his hand. In Omaha, the hand a player ends up is the best five-card combination that uses exactly two of his hole cards plus three of the board cards. Similarly in seven-card stud, the hand a player ends up with is the best five-card combination among the seven in his possession. For example, if a player has 9♥ 8♠ 7♥ in the hole and his board consists of 8♦ 7♠ 8♥ 6♥, his hand is the full house 8♠ 8♦ 8♥ 7♥ 7♠. <strong>3.</strong> One deal. “Who won the last hand?” (Also see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#41904">pot</a>, definition 3.) <strong>4.</strong> The play of one’s cards from the point of first receiving them until the showdown. This differs mainly in point of view from the preceding. “I was second-best the last five hands.” <strong>5.</strong> The actual play of the cards at a table from the point of their first being dealt until the showdown. This also differs mainly in point of view from the preceding two definitions. “I didn’t have even as good as an ace the last 10 hands.” <strong>6.</strong> A good hand. “I didn’t put him on a hand.” “With that kind of betting, you know you’re against a player who has a hand.” <strong>7.</strong> The holder of a particular hand. “That hand never had to put in a raise because all of the other players kept raising for him.” <strong>8.</strong> <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#52255">Poker hand</a>. <strong>9.</strong> When preceded by <em>the</em>, the right hand for the situation. “I had the hand to get all his chips. Unfortunately, he missed his draw.”</p>
<div>
<p><strong>hand for hand</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>adv phrase</em>) The situation that arises near the end of a tournament in which, usually, two tables remain and a few players must bust out before the tables are combined for the final table, all of the players at which will finish in the money. Because some players might try to guarantee a place in the money by playing slowly, hoping to outlast someone else who might go broke, the tournament director sometimes stipulates that whichever table finishes a hand first must wait for the other table before starting the next deal, and the tables play <em>hand for hand</em>. Large tournaments sometimes play hand for hand — and involving multiple tables — when players approach being <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5532#33107">in the money</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="15301"></a>high-low split</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A form of poker in which the pot is split between the highest and lowest <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#11970">active</a> <em>qualifying</em> hands (if there are <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5548#27528">qualifiers</a>, that is certain minimum holdings for high and for low) or between the highest and lowest hands (if there are no qualifiers). If there are qualifiers, sometimes only the highest or lowest hand wins the whole pot. Sometimes both the highest and lowest hand are held by the same player, in which case that player wins the whole pot. (See <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#42658">scoop</a>, definition 4.) This is further complicated in games in which there is a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#10641">declaration</a>, that is, the use of chips or voice to indicate whether players are going for high, low, or both. Declaration is not common in public cardrooms, where high-low split games are usually played with what is called <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#13428">cards speak</a>. In games with a declaration, the pot is split between the holder of the highest hand <em>who declares high</em> and the holder of the lowest hand <em>who declares low</em>. (This makes it <em>theoretically</em> possible for the highest hand to win low and the lowest hand to win high. More common is a hand that would normally be in contention for only one direction (that is, high or low) to declare and win the other direction.) High-low split is often called simply <em>high-low</em>.</p>

<div>
<p><strong><a name="10175"></a>hold [someone] dead</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) Play a lowball hand in such a way as to keep another player pat on a worse hand, with the effect of keeping the player from drawing to a better hand, thus preventing the other player from winning the pot. For example, in a no-limit ace-to-five game, you open for the minimum, $4, with 8♠ 7♥ 3♣ 2♦ A♦. No one plays except the big blind, who raises $12. Both you and he have another $50 left. A lot of players would now go all in. If the other player has a pat 9, he now very likely will <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#32317">break</a> (definition 3) the hand and draw one card. In most instances, if he makes what he’s drawing to, you lose. The reason to reraise is to make more money if you win and to not have to worry about any bluffing after the draw — if you’re both all in before the draw, he can’t bet after. The reason <em>not</em> to reraise is to have the player stay pat with a worse hand than yours, that is, to <em>hold him dead</em>. If you don’t reraise, and he has a hand like 9♣ 8♥ 3♦ 2♠ joker, he’ll stand pat. When you then stand pat behind him, in most instances he will check after the draw, and you can’t possibly lose. Of course, if he had you beat all along, you can reason that it would have made no difference if you had put all the chips in the pot before the draw anyway. And if he bets all his chips after the draw even when you stand pat behind him, you still have a chance to fold.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) Generally, the rules by which a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#23521">house</a> runs all its games, not necessarily just poker. With respect to poker, usually including establishing of betting limits, number of raises, what causes a hand to become dead, how to handle violations of playing conventions, and so on. The house rules consist of the regulations of a particular cardroom on the conduct of a poker game, often codified in that cardroom’s <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#41557">rule book</a>, sometimes, particularly in a small establishment, posted on the wall. Poker rules are not standard, although most rule books contain many similar rules. Some rules (frequently termed the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#24932">rules of poker</a>), such as what hand beats what, are fairly standard, particularly in public cardrooms, while others, such as what constitutes a legitimate bet or raise and the manner in which betting must be made, vary widely.

<p><strong><a name="26635"></a>Hoyle</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Edmond Hoyle (1672-1769): English barrister and codifier of rules of games, author, in 1742, of <em>A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist</em>, which set down the rules of the game. Subsequent editions of the book contained treatments of quadrille, piquet, and backgammon. Hoyle wrote other books about games, and earned a reputation as an expert on rules. Over the years, the phrase “according to Hoyle” came to be synonymous with “by the highest authority.” Although Hoyle never wrote a word about poker — in fact, the game was probably not played in his time — his name has nonetheless come to be associated with the rules of poker. Since Hoyle’s death, several rules books on card games in general have had his name in their titles; many of those books have dealt with poker.</p>
