<div>
<p><strong>implicit collusion</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A situation can arise in which the leader in a pot would prefer that one or more of his opponents fold because, while he has a positive expectation on his bet, he is not a favorite against the field. In <em>implicit collusion</em>, all opponents come to an independent agreement — that is, without consulting among each other — to all play in such a way as to minimize the chance of the player with the best hand winning the pot. For example, in a hold’em tournament, a small stack may go all in and get called by one or more players with larger stacks. Those players collectively have a better chance of beating the all-in player than any does individually, and they may check down the hand till the end, that is, with no one making a bet that might drive anyone else out. The all-in player may have the best hand and be the favorite against any one of the others, but collectively, the remaining players have a better chance against the all-in player, and if they all understand — even though nothing is ever said to that effect — that all will check the hand down, that is <em>implicit collusion</em>. In another example, a bluff may have a high chance of success against any one opponent, but against multiple opponents have no chance at all. In low-limit games, with their many players remaining at the end, a bluff against the field has almost no chance of succeeding. Again, this involves <em>implicit collusion</em> among the players. They may not be aware of the situation, but it does exist. Similar situations arise in other games.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A variant of poker, usually played only in home games, in which players can see all hands except their own, and bet based on other players’ reactions to their and other hands.

<p><strong><a name="14837"></a>insurance</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) A side bet between two players, or between one player and an outsider (often known as an <em>insurance man</em>) who makes a business of this sort of thing, against a particular hand losing, usually made at a point before the fall of the final card or cards. For example, in a no-limit hold’em game, one player is all in on fourth street for his entire bankroll. If he loses, he has to leave this wonderful game, and probably go back to playing small limit. He has pocket aces, with another ace on the board. There are also two spades on the board, and his opponent has turned up his two spades in the hole. Our hero can lose only if a spade comes on the end that does not pair one of the other cards on the board. The odds against this can be worked out. The holder of the pair of aces can contract for <em>insurance</em>. If he loses the pot, the person with whom he arranged the insurance pays him some amount, usually equal to the value of the pot; if he wins, he pays that person some amount that, based on the odds against his losing, allows that person to make a profit (that is, have a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#10170">positive expectation</a> over the long run). The more desperate the person who makes the <em>insurance bet</em>, the worse the terms exacted by the seller of the insurance.</p>
