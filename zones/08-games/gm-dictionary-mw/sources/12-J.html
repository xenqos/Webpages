<p><strong><a name="10943"></a>jackpot</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> A progressive prize in some cardrooms given to the player who gets a specific very good hand beat. In hold’em, this is usually aces full or higher, plus there usually is a stipulation that both hole cards must play. (That is, a jackpot is not awarded if either hand involved uses only one of its hole cards to form the best hand.) Thus, for example, if the board were A♠ A♥ K♠ K♥ J♥, and Emilie had A♦ 9♦, while John had K♦ K♣, Emilie would not be eligible for the jackpot, even though her aces full got beat, because her 9♦ did not play. In <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#76569">ace-to-five lowball</a>, usually a 6-4 must be beat. In other high games, it’s some given hand, perhaps aces full, or four of a kind. The procedure for collection of the prize fund differs in each cardroom. In some, part of the antes or blinds, called the <em>jackpot drop</em>, is taken each hand and added to the jackpot fund. The procedure for awarding the jackpot also varies widely. In some clubs, the fund is for all games; in others, it is for a specific game. That is, for example, the 2-4 hold’em (all tables at that limit) may have one jackpot, while the 3-6 and 5-10 each has its own separate jackpot. The usual procedure is the holder of the beaten hand receives the largest share of the jackpot; the holder of the hand that beats the loser receives a smaller percentage; while the remainder of the players split a third portion. The division might be 50 percent of the jackpot to the loser, 25 percent to the holder of the winning hand, and 25 percent split among the other players at the table. In some large clubs, the jackpots frequently grow into the tens of thousands of dollars, leading to the interesting phenomenon of players specifically trying to get their hands beat, and often staying in for several bets on hands they might not otherwise play. Also called <em>bad beat jackpot</em>. Also see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#18364">double jackpot</a>, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#70374">triple jackpot</a>. <strong>2.</strong> The top prize or prizes on a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5559#22089">video poker machine</a>, usually paid for getting a royal flush or four of a kind, sometimes <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#69307">progressive</a>. <strong>3.</strong> The top prize or prizes in various house-banked casino games, sometimes <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#69307">progressive</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="21095"></a>jackpots</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) A form of high draw poker, in which a player cannot open the pot without holding at least two jacks as <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5544#32213">openers</a> (definition 1) before the draw. This is the same as <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5534#11165">jacks or better</a>; the term <em>jackpots</em> is mostly used in home games. In some home games, there may be a progression of openers. That is, if no one opens on a jackpots hand, the cards are shuffled and redealt and the next hand is played with queens as openers (<em>queenpots</em>), followed by <em>kingpots</em> and <em>acepots</em>. The players may ante each new deal and the progression usually stops (and remains until opened) at acepots. After the acepots hand is opened and played, the game usually reverts to jackpots. See <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#26057">progressive jackpots</a>.</p>

If no player opens for high — and to do so he <em>must</em> have at least a pair of jacks (and he must <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#37589">show openers</a> at some point) — then the hand is played for low (as described under <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#37159">ace-to-five</a>), again starting with the player to the left of the dealer. At this point, the game becomes <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#18809">bet-or-fold</a>.</p>
