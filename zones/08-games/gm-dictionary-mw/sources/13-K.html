<p><strong><a name="12181"></a>keep it or shove it</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A form of five-card stud, found only in home games, a high-low game in which, after each player has been dealt one downcard, each player gets a choice, in order, on each succeeding card. When each player has one downcard, there is a betting round. The dealer then offers a card off the deck to the first player. If the player wants that card, he keeps it. If he does not want it, he immediately gets the next card off the deck, and the first card is offered to the second player, who has the same options. He can take the card, or immediately get the next card off the deck, in which case the spurned card is offered to the third player, and so on. This continues until everyone has one upcard, at which point there is a second round of betting. Any card that goes all the way around the table without stopping at anyone, including the dealer, becomes dead. After the betting has been equalized, the operation starts all over, with a card being offered in turn to each player. After each time of each <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#11970">active</a> player having the same number of upcards, another round of betting ensues. After each player has four upcards, each player has the opportunity of replacing an upcard with an upcard, or the downcard with another downcard (the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#21846">twist</a>), followed again, of course, by another round of betting, and then a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#10641">declaration</a>, and then the determination of the two winners. The game has high <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#23710">dealer advantage</a>. This game is sometimes called <em>take it or leave it</em>, <em>shove ’em along</em>, or <em>push</em>. It is also sometimes called <em>pass the trash</em>, although that name is more often reserved for <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#28216">Anaconda</a>.</p>

<p><strong>kick</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v</em>) <strong>1.</strong> <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#23387">Raise</a>. “I’ll kick it” means “I raise.” For this meaning, <em>bump</em> is sometimes used, but generally only in home games or by beginning poker players. <strong>2.</strong> Hit a kicker on the draw (in draw poker). “My kicker kicked” means I drew two to a pair with a kicker and hit that kicker. If you draw to a pair of kings with an ace and make two pair, aces and kings, you <em>kicked</em>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="26536"></a>kicker</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> In hold’em, the unpaired card that goes with a player’s pair or three of a kind. Often, the rank of the kicker determines the winner of the pot. For example, if you have A♣ K♥, and I have K♠ Q♦, and the board is K♣ J♦ 7♠ 5♥ 2♦, you win; your pair of kings with an ace kicker beats my pair of kings with a queen kicker. <strong>2.</strong> In hold’em, the unpaired card that accompanies a player’s higher hole card. For example, if you have A-Q, the queen is the kicker. <strong>3.</strong> In draw poker, a side card (one of a different rank) held, when drawing, with a pair or three of a kind, to disguise the hand or to try to improve the hand. Often the<em>kicker</em> is an ace. For example, a player opens with two kings. At the draw, the player keeps an ace with the two kings and requests two cards. The player hopes to fool the others into thinking he has three of a kind, and also hopes to make two pair, aces and kings. (This particular player doesn’t fool anyone; if he<em>really</em> had three of a kind, he would have drawn one card — again keeping a kicker. He also has decreased his overall chances of improvement; drawing three to a pair improves the hand more often than drawing two to a pair with a kicker.) <strong>3.</strong> <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#12804">Side card</a> (definition 2).</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="90777"></a>kicker trouble</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In hold’em, when two players have the same pair formed by a hole card matching one on the board, the one with the smaller <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#12804">side card</a> is said to have <em>kicker trouble</em>. For example, on a flop of A-10-5, a player with A-J has kicker trouble against any A-K or A-Q hand. Unless a jack hits (or both a king and queen come in the next two cards), the A-J hand will lose.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>v</em>) <strong>1.</strong> <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5544#10538">Overblind</a> (definition 1), or sometimes just <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#33323">blind</a> (definition 3). “I’ll kill it” means the pot has probably already been blinded and I’m putting in another blind that is (in a no-limit game at least twice and in a limit game exactly twice) the size of the largest blind already in. Less often to <em>kill</em> means to blind a pot that does not yet have a blind. <strong>2.</strong> Deliberately make a hand <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#22815">dead</a> (definition 3) by a dealer prior to exposing the hand when requested by a player. This is so the hand can be shown without causing any possible arguments that the hand might be legally entitled to the pot because it is still <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#31816">live</a> (definition 7). For example, John bets on the river in hold’em, and Sue calls. As soon as Sue puts her chips in, John discards his cards unshown, indicating that he was bluffing and any hand that can call has him beat. Willie, however, wants to see the hand, perhaps because he wants to get a line on John’s play, and says to the dealer, “Turn that hand up.” Since John’s was a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#25205">called hand</a>, the dealer must, by the rules in most cardrooms, expose the hand. He picks up John’s cards, taps them against the discards (thus <em>killing</em> the hand), and only then turns them face up. — (<em>n</em>) <strong>3.</strong> <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5544#10538">Overblind</a> (definition 2) or <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#33323">blind</a> (definition 1), that is, the act of <em>killing</em> a pot or the chips represented by that act. “It was already $40-to-go and he put a kill in” means he made it $80 minimum bet. <strong>4.</strong> Win a lot of money from a game or a specific opponent. “He’s been killing the $20-$40 lately.” “Chloe’s been killing me all evening.”</p>

<div>
<p><strong><a name="40904"></a>kill pot</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) To stimulate action, some games require a player winning two pots in a row or the winner of a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#45693">scoop pot</a> to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5536#13330">kill</a> the next pot.

<p><strong><a name="54072"></a>kill the action</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) Not make as much on a hand as the cards warrant due to the way in which one played the hand. For example, if, in a big bet game, someone limps in early position and then reraises when raised, that often indicates that the player so doing has a big hand, and he will likely not get much action for the rest of the hand. The reraise is likely to fold others in the pot, including the original raiser, or at least cause opponents to tread warily. Such a play is said to <em>kill the action</em>. Also, <em>kill one’s/your action</em>.</p>
<div>

This particular hand is also called a<em>pelter</em> or a <em>skeet</em>. Another variant is a hand with no card higher than a 9, no pair, and no four-flush or four-straight. Another is a sequence of cards, each separated by one rank, such as 2-4-6-8-10 or 5-7-9-J-K. This particular hand is also called an <em>alternate straight</em>, <em>Dutch straight</em>, or <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#21123">skip straight</a>.

<div>
<p><strong><a name="14818"></a>knock poker</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A combination of rummy and poker, usually played at home games by two to four players while waiting for a “real” poker session to start. As in draw poker, each player receives five cards face down. As in gin rummy, the remainder of the deck is placed in the center of the table, and the top card is turned over, starting a discard pile. The player to the left of the dealer has three choices: <em>knock</em>, draw a card from the deck, or draw the top card from the discard pile. If he doesn’t knock — and he can only do so if he doesn’t draw a card — after drawing, he discards a card face up on the discard pile. Each player in rotation has the same three choices. If a player feels that he has the best poker hand at any point when it is his turn, he can knock. If his hand is indeed best, he collects one chip (or some other agreed-upon amount) from each player; if it is not, he loses two chips (or, again, some other agreed-upon amount) to the player whose hand beats his. Obviously (or not so obviously), the further the game progresses without someone knocking, the better the hand needed to knock. This could mean taking a chance right at the start with one large pair. Several variations exist to this game; the preceding description is the most common. Compare with <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5561#15067">whiskey poker</a>.</p>
