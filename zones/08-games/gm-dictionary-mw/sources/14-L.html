<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> A betting scheme, used only in home games, in which the betting on one round begins with the player who initiated the betting on the previous round (if there was no raise), or with the player who put in the last raise that was called around. In stud games, the actual boards of the players have no relevance. If there was no betting on the previous round, then it goes back to the last bet of the round before. For example, in a stud game, after the first upcard, John, under the gun, makes the forced high-card bet, showing an ace. Two players call, and Andy raises, showing a queen. One player calls behind, as do John and the other two players. On the next card, John has A-K and Andy has Q-J. Andy, having put in the last raise, bets first. All call. Andy is again first on the next round. <strong>2.</strong> In a hand featuring betting with multiple raises, the last raise on a particular round. “The live one put in the last bet every round and caught runner-runner spades.” This means that the player in question raised every round, perhaps putting in the third or fourth bet.</p>

The <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#42445">penultimate card</a> is dealt, and then all discards and the last card are shuffled and the remaining draw cards dealt from those cards. (Sometimes the cards of the person about to receive cards are not shuffled in so that the player cannot receive his own discards on the draw.)</p>
<div>
<p><strong>last-card Louie</strong></p>

If the player likes his cards, he “lets it ride.” If he doesn’t like them, he requests the first bet back. Whatever the player’s decision, then the dealer turns over one of the two community cards. If the player still likes his cards, he can again “let it ride” or request back his second bet. Finally, the dealer turns over the second community card and pays all winners according to a pay table, ranging from even money on a pair of 10s or better to 1,000:1 for a royal flush. A player can also make an extra side bet, with certain bonus hands paying large payouts, sometimes including part or all of a progressive jackpot. The game was invented by Shuffle Master, a company that makes automatic card-shuffling machines for casinos and cardrooms and devises new casino games. The game was formerly known as <em>Let It Ride!</em> (including the exclamation point); some casinos still use that name.</p>

<p><strong><a name="38834"></a>liar’s poker</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A gambling game that uses cards (usually) and poker rankings but is not considered a form of poker. Players ante some agreed-upon amount, receive (usually) five cards, and in turn announce their holdings, challenge the previous call, or fold (forfeiting whatever they have put in the pot), with the proviso that each successive claim must be higher than the preceding one. If a player challenges and the previous player cannot produce what he called, the challengee must pay some penalty to the pot. If the challengee can show what he called, the challenger must pay the penalty. The game might stop at that point, or continue. The game is sometimes played with <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#58029">poker dice</a> or ordinary dice, where it is more commonly called <em>liar’s dice</em>. It is also played with currency, where it is more commonly called <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#84214">dollar bill poker</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="24423"></a>lights</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) In a home game, a situation that comes up when a player is <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#29068">light</a> (definition 1). In some home games, not played for <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#24410">table stakes</a>, when a player does not have enough chips to continue betting in a pot, that player withdraws chips from the pot equal to the amount of the betting beyond his chips, (usually) stacking them neatly in front of him. These are called <em>lights</em>. (To withdraw chips in this manner is called <em>go light</em>.) At the end of the hand, if the player does not win the pot, he buys enough chips to cover his lights. He then <em>matches his lights</em>, that is, puts the lights into the pot plus an equivalent amount of chips from the ones he has just bought. For example, in a stud game, Jill starts with $16. After the sixth card, she has $2 left. The high hand bets $4. She puts her last $2 in the pot, and pulls $2 from the pot, and stacks it in front of her. At this point, she might say, “I’m light,” or, “I’m going light.” On the last round, someone bets $4 and someone calls. She pulls another $4 from the pot, adding it to her pile of lights. On the showdown, she finds that her three 7s are beat by a small straight. She buys another $50 worth of chips from the banker, adds $6 to her lights, and puts the $12 in the pot. At this point, the winner takes the whole pot. In a split (two-way) pot, if either the winner of the high half or the winner of the low half has lights, or both do, they <em>exchange lights</em> and then split the pot. This is equivalent to each first matching lights, and then splitting the pot, and saves time.</p>

<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> The size of the betting increments in a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#20487">limit game</a>. This will seem obvious to most, but the limit in a $2-limit game is $2, while the limit in a $2-$4 game is first $2 and then $4. Also called <em>betting limit</em>. <strong>2.</strong> <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#41992">Limit poker</a>. “I prefer limit to no-limit.” <strong>3.</strong> “The limit” is an expression used by draw poker players at the time of the draw referring to how many cards they wish. In high, the expression “Give me the limit” means “Give me three cards”; in lowball, “Give me one card.” So called, because “the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#36169">book</a>” supposedly says that good draw poker players take no more than three cards and good lowball players take no more than one.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#41992">Limit poker</a>, or, more specifically, an instance of a game played with <em>limit stakes</em>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="41992"></a>limit poker</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A form of poker in which all bets are in increments of the <em>betting limit</em>, which is usually at one level in early rounds of betting and twice that level in the remaining rounds. For example, in a $2-$4 game, players can bet or raise only $2 at a time on the first rounds, and, similarly, only $4 at a time on later rounds. Limit poker is often called <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#29820">structured limit</a>, and the most common variety is <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#32203">double limit</a>, in which the betting increments double after the draw. In <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#18926">single limit</a> (also known as <em>straight limit</em>), <em>all</em> bets are in multiples of the limit. In <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#32203">double limit</a>, the size of the game is usually expressed as two numbers, as, variously, 3/6, 3-6, $3/$6, $3-$6, 5/10, and so on, while in single-limit, one number, as $2-limit (which game is also called the <em>two-limit</em>, the <em>two</em>, or the <em>deuce</em>) or $80-limit.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="86239"></a>limit raise</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#10461">big bet game</a>, raising an amount equivalent to the preceding bet or raise. This has significance because usually a reraise is larger. For example, if Emilie opens for $10, John raises $40, and Chloe reraises $40 (assuming that both she and John have plenty more chips), Chloe’s raises would be called a<em>limit raise</em> (or possibly <em>limit reraise</em>).</p>

<p><strong><a name="28638"></a>live blind</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> In a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#31769">structured-limit game</a>, including almost any <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#94859">flop game</a> and some lowball games, a blind that can be raised even when the opening bet is not a raise. For example, in a $3-$6 hold’em game, the player to the dealer’s left puts $3 in the pot before receiving his cards and the player to his left puts in $6. The first player to open <em>often</em> opens for $12, that is, by raising, but not always. In a <em>live blind</em> game, if the pot is opened for $6 (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#35532">limp</a>) and no one raises, when the action returns to the big blind, he has the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5544#78105">option</a> of raising, or just calling and closing the action (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#38371">close the action</a>). <strong>2.</strong> A blind a player gets to keep when he wins a pot, because the next pot will be blinded by someone other than the winner of the present pot. Examples of <em>live blinds</em> are those in a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#26933">traveling blind game</a>, or those in a game in which each player must blind the pot at least once within a specified period of time.

<p><strong><a name="74710"></a>look</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Call, especially the final bet or raise before the showdown; often followed by <em>at</em>. If someone bets at you and you say, “I’ll look,” that means, “I’ll call you.” “I’ll look at you” means the same. In most cardrooms, saying “I’ll look” is <em>not</em> equivalent to saying “I call.” The latter is usually binding, that is, if you say “I call” when it is your turn to act, you must put chips in the pot, even if the other player shows his cards before you have a chance to physically get them in. (It’s usually a good idea, however, unless you know the other player very well, to wait until the chips are actually in the pot before showing your cards, even in establishments in which verbal declarations are binding. Saves arguments later.) “I’ll look” is generally a phrase said accompanying the actual act of placing the calling chips in the pot, and is generally not binding (although it could be interpreted that way: another reason to be careful of what you say in turn). In this sense, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#31192">see</a> [<em>the</em> or <em>your bet</em>] is also frequently used. — (<em>n</em>) <strong>2.</strong> Part of the phrase <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#13616">free look</a>. <strong>3.</strong> Part of the phrase <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#28368">look [someone] up</a>.</p>

In lowball, implies taking all the one-card draws to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#40046">rough</a> hands (that is hands that frequently lose even when they are made perfectly), and most of the two-card draws.
