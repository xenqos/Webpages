</div>
<p>(<em>v</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Catch the specific hand one is trying to end up with; often followed by <em>a</em> (or <em>the</em>) <em>hand</em>. In draw poker, if you start with 5-6-7-8-K of mixed suits, you discard the king, and on the draw receive either a 4 or 9, you have <em>made</em> a straight. You have also <em>made the hand</em> or <em>made a hand</em>. The phrases “I made” and “Did you make?” are elliptical, that is, “I made my hand” and “Did you make the hand (or your hand)?,” respectively, are understood. In lowball, to catch on the draw any card below one’s top card that does not give one a pair is to <em>make the hand</em>. Similarly, though used less often, in a stud or hold’em game, to turn a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#29006">drawing hand</a> into a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#24864">complete hand</a> (definition 2) is to <em>make the hand</em>. Also, <em>complete</em>, <em>fill</em>. <strong>2.</strong> Detect cheating or recognize someone as a cheater. “Did the floorman make you?” means “Did the floorman notice that you were cheating?” <strong>3.</strong> Shuffle the cards prior to the next deal; same as <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5540#10776">make the pack</a>. <strong>4.</strong>Earn or win. “How much did you make today?”</p>

<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Pay money owed to the pot, usually by matching one’s <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#24423">lights</a>, which are (usually only in a home game) chips removed from the pot by a player who has run out of chips but has agreed to stand good on any bets, chips equal in amount to the betting from the point at which the player ran out of chips. If the player loses the pot, he must <em>make good</em> on the money owed. For example, if he had gone light by $10, he must return those $10 in chips to the pot, plus another $10 in cash (or purchase more chips and add another $10 to the pot).

<p><strong><a name="21603"></a>Mambo stud</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A combination between stud and a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5561#16743">widow game</a>, in which players use three cards in their hands plus one <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#33707">community card</a>, played high-low. Each player is dealt one downcard and one upcard, followed by a round of betting, one more upcard, one more round of betting, and then a community card, with a final round of betting. Players use any combination of three of their four cards for high hand and any three for low. Hand rankings differ from “ordinary poker.” The best ranking low hand, A-2-3, is called a Low Mambo, and the highest ranking high hand, Q-K-A suited, is called a High Mambo. The remaining high hands rank this way: straight flush, three of a kind, straight, flush, one pair, highest card rank. There is a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5548#32197">qualifier</a> for low: to win the low half, a hand must be 6-high or better. One worse than a Low Mambo is A-2-4, and so on. If there is no low, the entire pot goes to the high hand.</p>

<div>
<p><strong><a name="80505"></a>Manila</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) A variant of <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#23406">hold’em</a>, popular in Australian casinos, played with a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#43611">stripper deck</a> from which all cards 2-6 have been removed (leaving 32 cards). Each player is dealt two hole cards. The dealer places five community cards one at a time face up in the center of the table, each followed by a round of betting. At the showdown, unlike hold’em, each player forms his best poker hand using both hole cards with exactly three of the five community cards. Because of the stripped deck, a flush beats a full house (because a flush occurs less often), but other hand rankings are the same as conventional poker. Also, an ace cannot form the low end of a straight (thus, the hand A-7-8-9-10 is not a straight in Manila). This form of the game is also known as <em>two-card Manila</em> and <em>seven-up poker</em>. In three-card Manila, players are dealt three cards, and the rest of the game remains the same. At the showdown, similar to Omaha, each player forms his best poker hand using a combination of any two of his three hole cards with exactly three of the five community cards. The three-card variant is sometimes played with the 6s restored to the deck (making 36 cards).</p>

<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A way of holding the cards popular with mechanics (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5540#13186">mechanic</a>), because it’s easiest to deal seconds, bottoms, or middles when holding the deck this way. A right-handed dealer holds the deck in his left hand, with the thumb along the left edge, the forefinger at the front, and the other three fingers curled around the right edge. (A left-handed dealer does the same with his right hand.) Since many noncheating players also hold the deck this way, the grip alone is not evidence enough to accuse a player of cheating.</p>

Each player receives a total of five cards, of which one must always be face down. After the first two cards are dealt (one up and one down), a betting round begins with the high card. After the betting round is complete, players can expose their downcards if they wish. The next card is dealt up or down depending on whether the prior downcard was exposed. After all five cards have been dealt to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#11970">active</a> players in the same manner and all betting completed, the highest ranking hand wins the pot. There is one hand ranking difference from standard forms of poker. In Mexican stud, a flush beats a full house.

<p><strong><a name="55978"></a>Minnesota hold’em</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A house-banked game, played in Minnesota casinos, dealt from one deck, in which players play separately against the dealer. The game is related to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#23406">hold’em</a> in the way hands are formed, but is not really a poker game. Each player makes an initial wager called the <em>blind</em>. Each player and the dealer receives two hole cards. Each player then has three choices: place a wager equal to the blind in the call spot, place a wager twice the size of the blind in the raise spot, or fold, forfeiting the blind. The dealer then deals five community cards to the board. At least one card from the player’s hand must be used to make the best 5-card poker hand. Only the dealer may play the board (use all five community cards). The dealer must have a pair or better to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5548#75033">qualify</a> (definition 2). If the dealer does not qualify, the call or raise is a push and the player is paid even money on the blind. If the dealer does qualify, both bets are in play. If the player loses, he loses both bets. A tie is a push. If the player wins with a call, he receives even money for blind and call. If the player wins with a raise, he receives even money for blind and raise unless he has a flush or better, which wins a bonus as follows: flush, 2-1; full house 5-1; four of a kind 10-1; straight flush 30-1; royal flush 100-1.</p>

In some games, this could also be the lowest possible hand. For example, with straights and flushes not counted as low hands, 6-4-3-2-A would be a <em>minnie</em>.

</div>
<p>(<em>v</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Erroneously <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#10368">read</a> a hand, for example, think 3-4-5-6-8 is a straight when it is just an 8-high hand. Also, incorrectly see the cards of a hold’em flop or a seven-card stud board. <strong>2.</strong> Think an opponent has a hand quite different, either stronger, weaker, or of a different type, from what he actually holds. “I completely misread that one. I thought he was betting a flush draw, when he had top pair all along.”</p>

<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> In a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#94859">flop game</a> or seven-card stud, wrongly reckon your holding in relation to the board. For example, in Omaha, in which misreading the board is common, if your hole cards are 2-7-K-K and the board is 3-4-5-6-Q, you may mistakenly think you have a straight, but since you must play two of your hole cards, you actually have only a pair of kings. <strong>2.</strong> Erroneously read the cards of a hold’em flop or a seven-card stud board, and thus think you have a different hand from what you actually have. For example, if you have two hearts in the hole, and three red cards come on the flop, you may think they are three hearts and mistakenly think you have a flush.</p>

Mississippi straddles are common in the southern United States, hence the name. Like a live straddle, a Mississippi straddle must at least equal the bring-in bet plus a minimum raise. Action begins with the player to the left of the straddle. In some games, such a straddle is normally made by either the button or the cutoff. If, for example, in a game with $10 and $25 blinds, the button puts into the pot a live $50 Mississippi straddle, the first player to act would be the small blind, followed by the big blind, and so on. If action gets back to the straddle with no raise, the straddle has the option of raising. (See <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#28638">live blind</a>.)</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) Playing in such a way as to minimize your losses and maximize your wins. Many players win a little and quit, no matter how good the game, but when they get stuck, they often lose far more than they win in any winning session in a desperate attempt to get even. This is poor money management. For some, money management means quitting when ahead, and not losing back all of their winnings. For others, it means not putting all their bankroll on the table for any one session. For still others, it means putting aside a portion of their winnings into other money-making investments. Some poker writers claim that money management is not a viable concept.</p>

In a no-limit hold’em game, you might hear, “I knew I hadda beat a set. I’m already getting 3-to-2 in the pot, plus I get all his chips if I make the hand. I was getting money odds.” The term usually does <em>not</em> apply to a situation in which a player is getting better than 1-to-1 on his investment, but is taking the worst of it when comparing the odds against his making a winning hand with how much he can win for his investment. (That is, if a player stands to win $100 for a $50 investment, or 2-to-1, but the odds against him are 3-to-1, he is not getting money odds.)

<p><strong><a name="45498"></a>M-ratio</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In no-limit or pot-limit poker, a measure of the viability of a player’s stack as a function of the cost to play each round. Simply stated, someone can sit in a game, making only compulsory bets (that is, blinds and antes), for <em>M</em> rounds before running out of chips. A high M means a player can afford to wait several rounds before participating in a pot other than when in one of the blinds. This concept applies primarily to tournament poker, because in a cash game a player can effectively modify his M at will, merely by buying more chips. A player with a low M must act soon or be weakened by losing <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#26598">fold equity</a>. The concept was invented by backgammon and poker expert Paul Magriel, for whom the M stands. Here is the formula: M= S/(SB+BB+A), where <em>S</em> is stack size, <em>SB</em> is small blind, <em>BB</em> is big blind, and <em>A</em> is antes. For example, in a 10-handed game with blinds of $25 and $50 and an ante of $5, a player whose stack is $1,200 has an M-ratio of 750/(25+50+(5&#215;10)), or 10. Also called <em>M number</em> or simply <em>M</em>.</p>
