<p><strong><a name="49226"></a>optimal bluffing frequency</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) Bluffing in such a way that observant opponents cannot gain an advantage from their calling frequency. “Mathematically, the optimal bluffing strategy is to bluff in such a way that the chances against your bluffing are identical to the pot odds your opponent is getting.” (David Sklansky, <em>The Theory of Poker</em>.) The mathematically optimal bluffing strategy isn’t necessarily the best strategy; much better is the ability to judge when to try a bluff and when not to to show a larger overall profit. That is, bluff more often against timid players and less often against calling stations and those who think you bluff too much. Optimal bluffing frequency works best (most optimally) against players whose calling frequencies you do not know.

Acting out of turn is sometimes part of an <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#42262">angle shooter</a>’s repertoire.</p>

<p><strong><a name="39800"></a>outs</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) Cards that improve a hand, usually used with reference to a hand that is not currently the best hand. The term is most often used for hold’em, but can be used for stud or Omaha, and sometimes even draw games. For example, in hold’em you have A♠ 8♠, an opponent has 2♥ 2♣, and the board shows 2♦ J♠ Q♠ 9♦. Any 10 gives you a straight, and any spade gives you a flush. Four 10s remain, and nine spades. One of those spades, 10♠, was already accounted for among the 10s. Two of the spades that make you a flush also improve the three 2s to four of a kind (2♠) or a full house (9♠); thus, you have 10 <em>outs</em>. Compare with <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#38404">drawing dead</a>. Sometimes called <em>escape cards</em>.

If a player shows down an 8-4 and says, “I caught outside,” you know he caught the 8.

For definitions 2 and 3, also <em>oversize bet</em>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>overbet the pot</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> In a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#39547">pot-limit</a> game, (illegally) bet more than the size of the pot.

Sometimes called <em>go the overs</em>. — (<em>n</em>) <strong>2.</strong> The blind put in by the person who <em>overblinds</em>.

The reason for the rule is that one of the tactics of an <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#42262">angle shooter</a> is to miscall a hand hoping that the other player will inadvertently throw away the winning hand. If the loser then sees that the hand did not really have, for example, a flush, but only four hearts and a diamond, the <em>angler</em> then says, “Oh, sorry; I overlooked my hand. Thought I had a flush.” — (<em>n</em>) <strong>3.</strong> The act of so (definition 1) calling. “Wouldn’t you know that when I was bluffing, not only did Curly call me, but I got two overcalls!”</p>
