<p><strong><a name="17266"></a>race</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) <strong>1.</strong> The situation that occurs in a tournament at the point at which the limits are increased and the denomination of chips used at the lower limits is no longer needed for the current limits. First all chips are exchanged for the higher-denomination chips (<em>colored up</em>; see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#19008">color up</a>); then the odd chips are taken off in a procedure known as the <em>race for the odd chips</em>, or simply the <em>race</em>. After the conversion, the dealer or other person making the chip exchange shuffles the deck and deals each player that has odd chips, in order, one card face up for each odd chip. In one form of race, whoever gets the highest card, with ties settled by suits in <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#19946">bridge order</a>, gets all the odd chips. At whatever point the ace of spades appears, no further cards need be dealt, and whoever gets that card “wins” the odd chips; otherwise the cards are dealt until each player has one card for each chip. Those chips are then also <em>colored up</em> and the higher-denomination chips given to the winner. Any remaining odd chips are usually just removed from play. In another form of race, no one player gets more than one chip; chips are apportioned in order starting with the “winner” of the race. Here is an example of the first method: At the $10-$20 level, $5 chips are used. When the betting changes to $25-$50, $25 chips will be used. A house employee comes around to color up all even multiples of $25. At this point, every player now has zero, one, two, three, or four $5 chips. Each player puts those chips up in front of him and is dealt one card for each chip. The player who gets the highest card wins all the $5 chips, which are then colored up to quarters. Say Helen has four odd $5 chips, Stan has two, Pat has one, Alexandra has three, Elizabeth has none, Catherine has two, Jo has none, Matt has none, and Mike has four. The dealer shuffles the deck, and starts dealing cards face up, first four to Helen, two to Stan, one to Pat, three to Alexandra, none to Elizabeth, two to Catherine, none to Jo and Matt, and four to Mike. The ace of spades never appears, so the cards are dealt till Mike has four. When the cards are all out, no aces appeared. Helen got the king of diamonds and Stan the king of clubs; Helen gets all 12 chips, which are exchanged for two $25 chips; the other two odd $5 chips are taken out of play. It is possible to be knocked out of a tournament at the race if you have fewer than five chips total. In the other, more common method of race, no player can get all the odd chips. One card is still dealt for each odd chip, but whoever gets the highest card gets one chip of the higher denomination, whoever gets the next highest gets another, and so on, until all the odd chips are handled. In this method, anyone who would otherwise end up with no chips of the higher denomination gets one chip. Also called<em>chip race</em>. <strong>2.</strong> <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#94123">Race situation</a>. — (<em>v</em>) <strong>3.</strong> Participate in a <em>race</em>.

<p><strong><a name="30655"></a>reentry blind</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A blind that a player in a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#26933">traveling blind game</a> puts in to get a hand after missing the blinds in a game in which players must <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#25362">come in on the blind</a>. A reentry blind doubles the stakes for one hand, and the player who puts it in acts after the big blind on the first round. So, different from a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#30523">post</a>, the player does not act in turn; unless she put the reentry blind in immediately to the left of the big blin, the action skips her so that she can act last. For example, in a Southern California-style $20-$40 lowball game, Kate left the table before the big blind got to her and returned after it passed her position. The button is two positions to her left. The blinds are $10 from the button, $10 from the middle blind, and $20 from the big blind. Kate puts $20 in to get a hand. This hand will be played at $40-$80 limit. The player to the left of the big blind comes in for a raise (opens for $80). The next player folds. Kate is in the next seat. She does nothing. The next two players fold. The button calls, the middle blind folds, and the big bliind calls (by putting in an extra $60 to bring his bet to $80). Only now does Kate act. She has three options. She can fold. She can call (by adding $40). She can raise (by adding $80). After the draw, betting starts from the left of the button and proceeds clockwise, as usual.</p>

<p><strong><a name="77608"></a>reverse bridge order</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) Reverse suit order according to the game of bridge, that is, clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades. Reverse bridge order comes into play when breaking a tie for low card in determining who has the low-card <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#29610">forced bet</a> in seven-card stud, or who starts the deal on the first hand at a lowball or razz table when such deal is determined by giving each player one card face up and more than one instance of the same rank appears. Thus, if the 2♣ and 2♥ both came out, the holder of the 2♣ would get to deal. Compare with <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5501#19946">bridge order</a>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>reverse hold’em</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A variant of hold’em that differs from regular hold’em in that the flop is one card, the turn is one card, and the river is three cards. The game is usually played as <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#41992">limit poker</a>. Since a hand is not as well defined with the first two community cards as in regular hold’em at the same stage, players tend to speculate more. Additionally, because three cards hit at once at the end, the lead often changes at the finish. These characteristics attract action players who favor gambling over careful tactical play.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="29137"></a>reverse implied odds</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> The situation in which <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5532#13077">implied odds</a> are such that a hand will win the minimum if it is the best hand but lose the maximum if it is not. Some aggressive actions (bets and raises) can be subject to reverse implied odds, because they win the minimum if they win immediately (the current pot), but may lose the maximum if called (the current pot plus the called bet or raise). These situations may also occur when a player has a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#24864">complete hand</a> that has little chance of improving but might face a better hand or draw, and an opponent continues to bet. If the opponent is weak or bluffing, he will likely give up after the player calls and not call any bets or raises the player makes. If, though, the opponent has a superior hand, he will continue betting (extracting additional bets or calls from the player). Sometimes called <em>reverse</em> <em>implied pot odds</em>. Example from limit hold’em: In a $10-$20 game, on the turn, John limps from the small blind. Emilie has 2♣ 3♣ and the board is 4♠ 5♠ 6♠. John checks. Emilie flopped a straight and bets and John calls. The K♠ comes on the turn. John bets $20, bringing the pot to $60. Emilie can improve only to a 7-high straight, so if John has her beat, she cannot win. If John is weak or bluffing, Emilie expects no further bets or calls from John. If John has a superior hand, in the form of a higher straight or a flush, Emilie expects John to bet another $20 on the river. Therefore, if Emilie wins, she expects to win only the $60 currently in the pot, but if she loses, she expects to lose $40 (her $20 call on the turn plus a $20 call on the river). Because she is risking $40 to win $60, Emilie’s <em>reverse implied odds</em> are 1.5-to-1 ($60-to-$40) or 40% (1/(1.5+1)). For calling to have a positive expectation here, Emilie must believe the probability of John’s having a weak hand is more than 40%. <strong>2.</strong> More simply, the situation in which a player will make a hand and lose, probably because he’s drawing dead (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#28649">draw dead</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#27699">tell</a> that means the opposite of what one might expect. A common tell is acting weak when holding a strong hand; a <em>reverse tell</em> might be acting strong when holding a strong hand. A reverse tell is often deliberate. Also, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#94948">false tell</a> (definition 1), <em>fake tell</em>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="60348"></a>reward card</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) The standard club card that casinos issue to reward players. Players sign up, and receive points, often electronically verified, varying depending on length of play and size of bets. These points are then redeemable for merchandise, cash, tournament entry, parking, dining, hotel accommodations, and many other amenities. Some clubs and their cards are valid in only the issuing casino, such as the Cache Club of the Cache Creek Casino Resort in Brooks, California. Others are valid in any of the individual properties of a casino chain, such as Harrah’s Total Rewards Card. Some earn points only for slots play (which usually includes all machines, that is, also for video poker, video keno, video blackjack, and so on); others earn points also for table games, and sometimes also for any or all of live keno, poker, bingo, or the race and sportsbook.

<p><strong><a name="41557"></a>rule book</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) The written regulations (<a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#23704">poker rules</a>) of a particular cardroom on the conduct of a poker game. Poker rules are not standard, although most rule books contain many similar rules. Some rules, such as what hand beats what, are fairly standard, particularly in public cardrooms, while others, such as what constitutes a legitimate bet or raise and the manner in which betting must be made, vary widely. The smart player familiarizes herself with the rule book of a particular establishment before sitting down to play.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><a name="18980"></a>rule of 4-2</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) In hold’em, a shortcut odds calculation for a situation in which you know the number of outs you have. With two cards to come (that is, on the flop), multiply the number of outs by 4. With one card to come (that is, on the flop turn), multiply the number of outs by 2. This produces an approximation of the percentage of success. For example, if you have a four-card flush on the flop, you have 9 outs. With two cards to come, multiply 9 by 4 to get a 36% chance of making the flush. (The actual figure is about 35%.) With one card to come, multiply 9 by 2 to get 18%. (The actual figure is about 19.6%.) This is only an approximation and doesn’t work for all situations, but it’s often close and is an easy calculation to perform in your head. This rule does not, of course, take into account the opponent’s chance of improving. Sometimes called <em>rule of 2 and 4</em>.</p>

I start with pocket rockets, it’s capped before the flop, I flop a set, I’m betting all the way, the live one stays with deuce-seven suited and of course catches runner-runner, while I’m just praying to pair the board, because I know what’s gonna happen when I see two hearts and him hanging on.” Also applied to <em>any</em> situation in which two <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5550#40843">running</a> cards are needed to win.
