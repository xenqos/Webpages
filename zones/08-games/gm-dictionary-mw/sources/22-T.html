<div>
<p><strong><a name="21383"></a>tab card</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A credit account available in some casinos or cardrooms to favored customers (generally those on whom a credit check has been run), to which a player can charge chips to play on. This is a convenient means for a player to get around the difficulty of carrying large amounts of cash on his person. The tab card is usually kept track of on a ledger card with transactions initialed by the player or a house official or both. The cashier is usually responsible for keeping the records straight (often on the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5552#24655">sheet</a>). In most clubs, a player is supposed to leave a check for the amount charged at the end of a playing session if he does not cash in as much as he charged. Frequently a player with charging privileges does so against a blank, signed check. If he loses, he fills out the check for the proper amount; if he wins, the blank check remains attached to his tab card, to be used the next time. When such a player calls for chips at the table, he usually fills out a charge slip, called a <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#15811">ticket</a> (definition 2), for the amount requested. Sometimes shortened to just <em>tab</em>. Also see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#21777">player’s bank</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> A humorous name for the player who takes it upon himself to arbitrate in all matters requiring decisions, settle all disputes, and interpret all rules.

<p><strong><a name="13400"></a>take the middle blind</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>v phrase</em>) Sit down at the precise moment it is your turn to put in the <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5540#31069">middle blind</a>. Some clubs do not let a new player (new to the particular game) be dealt in until it is his turn to put in a blind, supposedly to prevent his getting any “free” hands. (Also, if a seated player has missed the blind in a particular round, he can receive his next hand only in the blind position, by posting, or by killing the pot, that is, overblinding.) Some clubs, however, permit a player to receive his first hand, if he is too late to get the big blind, in the middle position. (That is, normally the first hand he could take would be when first sitting down two positions to the left of the deal position. Here we speak of first sitting down immediately to the left of the deal.) In such case, the player must in the next three hands still put in an amount equal to how much he would put in if he sat through all three blinds. This requires putting in the dealer’s blind when the deal is one position to his left, so that that player does not end up having to put too much in in the form of blinds. Also, when the player <em>takes it in the middle</em>, the player to his left puts in an amount equal to that of what the middle blind ordinarily is (since that player put in the big blind the previous hand and would ordinarily be putting in the middle blind this hand). To take the middle blind is also called <em>come in in the middle</em>. An example makes this clear. In a $30-limit lowball game (California style), blinds are normally $5-$10-$15. John sits in the open seat to Fred’s left on Fred’s deal, and asks to <em>take it in the middle</em>. The blind structures for the next three hands follow. On the first hand, Fred, in deal position, blinds $5; he had the middle blind last hand. John, taking it in the middle, blinds $15. Gary, who had the big blind last hand, before John sat down, now puts up $10. (When the betting gets to the blinds, they act in order of size; that is, first Fred, then Gary, then John.) For the second hand, John has the deal and puts $10 in on the button. Gary, now in the middle position, puts in $5, because he put in $15 and $10 on the preceding two hands, and Paul, who has not yet had a blind, puts in his regular $15. (When the betting gets to the blinds, they act in order of size; that is, first Gary, then John, then Paul.) On the third hand, John, now sitting one position to the right of the deal, puts in $5; he has put in a total of $30 over the last three hands. Gary, now on the button, puts in nothing; he has already put in $30 for this round. Paul puts in $10, as normal, for the middle blind, and Susie, to Paul’s left, puts in $15 for the big blind. (When the betting gets to the blinds, Gary acts before John.) See <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#25362">come in on the blind</a>, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5536#13330">kill</a>, <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5544#10538">overblind</a>, and <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#30523">post</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="44617"></a>take the odds</strong></p>

<p><strong><a name="75959"></a>TEARS</strong></p>
</div>
<p>A tournament format, invented by Tex Morgan (hence the official name of the system, Tex’s TEARS), in which blinds and antes increase in smaller increments, and sometimes also with increased level durations, than had been at use in most tournaments prior to the introduction of this format. Rather than the 100 percent increase that was common, the increase might be only 50 percent. So instead of 20-minute rounds proceeding at, for example, 100-200, 200-400, 400-800, and so on, there might be 30-minute rounds proceeding at 100-200, 150-300, 200-400, and so on. The system was introduced to provide more emphasis on skill for players and to give tournament directors more ability to determine the actual duration of a tournament. The actual time and level increments can be tweaked to cause any tournament to last as long as the organizers wish. The acronym stands for Tournament Evaluation And Rating System.</p>

<p><strong>Texas Hold’em Bonus Poker</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A house-banked card game, dealt from one standard 52-card deck, which uses poker hand rankings and has a lot of similarities to the “real” <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#23406">hold’em</a>, but nevertheless still is not poker. Players play separately against the dealer. Each player makes an <em>ante</em> bet and can make an additional side bonus bet. Each player plus the dealer receives two face-down cards. After looking at his cards, the player can either forfeit the ante, or place a flop bet, which must be twice the size of the ante bet. The dealer deals the flop (three community cards, just as in hold’em). At this point, the player can make a turn bet, equal in size to the flop bet, or stay in the game but make no further bets. The dealer deals the turn card. At this point, if the player made a turn bet, he can also make a river bet, also equal in size to the flop bet, or, again stay in the game but elect not to bet. When all five community cards are dealt, the dealer turns up his cards and each hand plays against the dealer’s hand. Just as in hold’em, players and dealer form their best hand by using two hole cards (see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#11384">hole card</a>), one, or none (playing the board) in combination with the community cards. There is no minimum qualifying hand, but the dealer pays the ante bet only if the player’s winning hand is a flush or better; ties are pushes. Thus, if a player beats the dealer but has a straight or lower, the dealer pays the river and turn (if made) and flop bets, but not the ante bet. Separately, the bonus bet pays for certain combinations in the player’s original two-card hand according to a pay table, with hands like pocket aces earning 30:1, suited A-K, 25:1, and other pocket pairs, A-K (unsuited), A-Q, and A-J also paying.</p>

<div>
<p><strong><a name="59272"></a>Texas Shootout</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A house-banked card game, dealt from six standard 52-card decks, which uses poker hand rankings and looks like a combination of <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5530#23406">hold’em</a> and <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#24570">pineapple</a> (but is otherwise not poker), in which players and dealer each receive four downcards and the object is to make a better hand than the dealer. Each player places a main bet and can optionally place a Shootout Bonus side bet. Each player decides on two cards to play, and discards the other two. Optionally, a player can split the cards into two two-card hands by adding an additional bet equal to the main bet. If a player splits this way, he can also optionally make another Shootout Bonus equal to the first. The dealer plays his cards according to set rules (“house way”). After all hands have been “set,” the dealer places five cards face up in the center of the table (the flop). Hands are then formed as in hold’em, with each player using the best combination of five cards from among his two cards and the five community cards. Since six decks are used, five of a kind, both suited and unsuited, are possible hands. A flush containing one pair, two pair, or three of a kind, is also possible, but it counts merely as a flush. When comparing flushes, only the high cards come into play. So, for example, J♦ J♦ 7♦ 7♦ 3♦ beats 10♥ 9♥ 9♥ 9♥ 3♥, and K♠ 9♠ 8♠ 8♠ 4♠ beats both J♦ J♦ 7♦ 7♦ 3♦ and 10♥ 9♥ 9♥ 9♥ 3♥. Winning wagers are paid 1:1. Shootout Bonus bets are paid according to pay tables, which differ at different casinos. Suited five of a kind might pay 5,000:1 or 1,000:1; a royal flush might pay 500:1 or 200:1; down to three of a kind which might either lose or pay even money, depending on the pay table used. If any player gets a straight flush or five of a kind, then all other players who placed a side bet of a certain minimum (usually $5) get an “envy bonus” (because they envy the person who got the good hand). Rules are always posted, which you should read.</p>

(See <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#34249">pick [someone] up</a>.)

</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) A <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#28641">California game</a> that combines elements of <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5546#41655">pai gow poker</a> and poker. The game is played with four players, each one taking turns at dealing or being in dealer position. Each player is dealt 13 cards, which the player arranges into three separate poker hands: one three-card hand in front and two-five card hands; each hand must rank higher than the hand before it. (In one variation, the middle hand is ranked according to <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#11010">deuce-to-seven lowball</a>.) The goal of the game is for all three of the player’s hands to rank higher than the opponent’s hands. Each player’s set of hands competes separately and one at a time against each other player’s set of hands. Each winning hand receives one or more chips, at whatever is the preestablished rate for the game, from the other player. In addition, certain rare hands (three of a kind or better, depending on in which hand they appear) rate bonuses from each player. The game is sometimes one of the events at major tournaments. Often called <em>Chinese poker</em>.</p>

For example, in a 5-5-10 no-limit lowball game, the dealer puts a $5 chip in the pot before receiving his cards, the next player puts in a $5 chip, and the big blind puts in two $5 chips. This makes the minimum bet $20; this also starts the pot off with $20 for anyone who opens to shoot at. (In games in which limping is permitted, the minimum bet would be $10. See <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5528#41327">gypsy</a> and <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5538#35532">limp</a>.)

<div>
<p><strong><a name="44440"></a>three-card brag</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A player-banked game dealt from one deck, a complicated variant of poker involving a lot of blind betting. Players get three cards, and hands are ranked thus: three of a kind, straight flush, straight, flush, pair, no pair. Play begins with each player putting in an <em>ante bet</em> (the same amount for all) and the first player to the left of the dealer putting in an additional compulsory blind bet of at least the ante (more if he wishes). Each player then receives three cards. Action proceeds clockwise, with each player in turn having to at least match the last full bet or pass. A player can put in more if he wishes. Any player who looks at his cards (is <em>open</em>) must either fold or put in twice the amount of a player who has not looked (is <em>blind</em>). Betting continues until only two players remain and one “calls” the other by putting in the required bet and saying “turn you.” At this point, the cards are faced and the higher hand wins. Pots can get very large, particularly if some players do not look at their cards on their turn but just match or increase the current bet. As in poker, the house makes its money by taking a certain amount (the <em>rake</em> or <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5506#11034">drop</a>) out of each pot. Sometimes called <em>three-card poker</em>. A variant of three-card brag called <em>flush</em> is played in some casinos. Flush involves supplemental payoffs by each player when a hand of three of a kind appears, followed by several special hands being played, some involving four cards, two cards, and wild cards. It’s all very complicated, so be sure to find out all the rules before sitting down to play. (Unfortunately, particularly in casinos outside North America, which is primarily where the game is played, the rules are often neither posted nor available. Even if available, they might be in some language other than English.)</p>

</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) <strong>1.</strong> Any poker game played with three cards. Sometimes called <em>three-toed Pete</em>. <strong>2.</strong> A house-banked game that resembles poker only in the ranking of the hands, dealt from one deck, in which player and dealer each gets three cards. Two bets are made. For the original bet, a player is paid on certain holdings according to a pay scale, ranging from 40:1 for a three-card straight flush to even money on a pair. A player can also make a second bet, and then his hand competes against the dealer’s. If the player does not make the second bet, he loses the original bet. The dealer needs at least a queen high to qualify. Some casinos have other rules, sometimes involving three bets. <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5503#96040">Casino brag</a> is a variant. <strong>3.</strong> <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#62507">Three-card Manila</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3-5-7 poker</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) A house-banked game in which the player does not play against the dealer, but tries to make up to three different kinds of hands that are paid off according to posted pay tables, with different payoffs corresponding to the number of cards being played. While the game uses poker rankings, it is not poker. The player has two betting options. He can bet on the first two games (three- and five-card poker) or on all three games. The player can bet any amount on any hand, subject to the table minimum and maximum. The first two bets must always be made; playing the seven-card game is optional. The player receives three cards and there are four community cards. The first payoff is based on the player’s initial three-card hand. The third, optional, payoff is based on the player’s three cards combined with the first two of the community cards. If the player chooses to make the seven-card bet, the player has the option of surrendering (giving up half of that bet and getting the rest back) after seeing his first three cards. The seven-card option plays the best five-card poker hand that can be made from all seven cards.</p>

Unfortunately, the $2,000 difference will hurt very much the next day.</p>

<p><strong><a name="81140"></a>time bank</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n phrase</em>) An aggregated amount of time upon which a player can draw when he exceeds the allotted time for his action. This concept is most prevalent in online cardrooms (particularly in tournaments and fast games; see <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5513#13871">fast game</a>, definition 2), in which only a short time is given for each action. For example, a player might have a one-minute <em>time bank</em>. He might be allowed 10 seconds for any action. If he exceeds those 10 seconds for whatever reason, then any additional time is subtracted from the time bank. When the time bank is depleted, the player must act upon the current hand immediately (and any succeeding hand within the allotted time) or his cards become dead. If the allotted time is exceeded because the player’s connection to the Web site was dropped or otherwise compromised, some online cardrooms give an automatic extension and do not subtract from the time bank. Time banks are also used in some televised poker tournaments.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>triple-shot</strong></p>
</div>
<p>(<em>n</em>) A house-banked game dealt from one deck, in which players play three games in one separately against the dealer(casino war, blackjack, and poker, or any combination of these games). The three bets are independent so the player can bet any amount on each one, subject to table limits. The player’s and dealer’s first card determine the outcome of the war bet, which is settled at that point. (The player cannot “go to war.”) Then the player gets another card and plays out his blackjack hand. The blackjack segment differs from standard blackjack in that players can split only aces, receiving only one card, and that six cards 21 or less is an automatic winner. Then more cards are dealt to the player to complete a six-card poker hand. (While this portion of the game uses poker rankings, it is not poker.) Finally the dealer plays out his blackjack hand, settles the blackjack wagers, and then pays the player according to the value of the six-card poker hand, of which the best five cards are played. The poker portion payoffs start at either jacks or queens, and range from 1:1 for one pair to either 100:1 or 200:1 for a royal flush.</p>

<p>(<em>n</em>) A form of poker, found exclusively in home games, in which each player receives one card face down, followed by a round of betting, another face up, with another round of betting, and then each <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5499#11970">active</a> player has an optional replacement (as described under <a href="http://www.poker1.com/archives/5554#21846">twist</a>, but generally without having to pay for the card). The game is played high-low, with both the highest and lowest hand being two aces. Pairs win for high, followed by high-card combinations; that is, A-K ranks just below a pair of 2s. For low, the point total is used, with 2 being best, then 3; 4, next, can be formed in two ways, A-3 or a pair of 2s; and so on.</p>
