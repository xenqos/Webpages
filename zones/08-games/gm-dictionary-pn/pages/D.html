<a name='name.256'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Dark Bet</h2>
<p>To announce a bet on the next betting round <i>before</i> the card(s) for that round get dealt. The player announcing such a bet &quot;in the dark&quot; must be first to act on the coming round, and the announced bet is binding regardless of the card(s) dealt.</p>
<p>For example, in hold'em a player raises and another calls in position, then before the flop appears the preflop raiser says &quot;I bet $100 in the dark,&quot; meaning whatever cards come out, flop action begins with that $100 bet.</p>

<a name='name.263'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Dead Money</h2>
<p>In poker, &quot;dead money&quot; refers to the money in the pot that has been contributed by players who have folded. This term is used in both live and online poker games, and in both cash games and tournaments.</p>
<h3>What is Dead Money in Poker?</h3>
<p>Dead money in poker is a term used to describe the money in the pot that was contributed by players who have since folded. Since these players are no longer in the hand, they have no chance of winning the pot, hence their bets are considered &quot;dead&quot;.</p>
<p>Understanding and considering the concept of dead money can be a significant part of <b>poker strategy</b>. It can influence decisions on betting, as the dead money in the pot can sometimes justify making a call or a bluff that would otherwise be considered risky.</p>
<h3>Implications of Dead Money in Poker</h3>
<p>The presence of dead money in the pot can influence the <b>pot odds</b> and consequently, the decision-making process in poker. When there&#039;s a significant amount of dead money, it can make it profitable to make calls or bluffs that might otherwise be unprofitable.</p>
<p>However, a player should not make decisions based solely on the amount of dead money. Other factors, such as the strength of the player&#039;s hand, their position, and the tendencies of the other players, should also be taken into account.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Dead Money&quot;</h3>
<p>An example of dead money in poker could be in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em where several players make a bet pre-flop but then fold after the flop. The money they contributed to the pot is now considered dead money, as they have no chance of winning it back.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;There&#039;s a lot of dead money in the pot, so I&#039;m going to make a bluff.&quot;</li><li>&quot;He folded after making a large bet pre-flop, adding a lot of dead money to the pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The presence of dead money in the pot influenced her decision to call.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.269'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Dealer</h2>
<p>In poker, the &quot;Dealer&quot; refers to the person who shuffles the deck and distributes the cards to the players. In a home game, the dealer often participates in the game. In a casino or online setting, the dealer is a non-playing staff member. In terms of position, the dealer is the last to act in a round of betting.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Role of the Dealer in Poker </h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, the <b>Dealer</b> is a crucial figure who manages the game by shuffling the deck and dealing the cards to the players. In a home game, the dealer is often one of the players, with the role rotating around the table after each hand. In a casino or <b>online poker</b> setting, the dealer is a trained professional who doesn&#039;t participate in the game. This term is applicable in all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, in both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>In terms of the game&#039;s betting structure, the dealer is the last to act, giving them a positional advantage as they can observe all the other players&#039; actions before making their own.</p>
<h3>Examples of Dealer in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the role of the <b>Dealer</b> in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em live game, the dealer shuffles the deck and distributes two cards face-down to each player, starting with the player to their immediate left.</p>
<p>In an online poker tournament, the dealer&#039;s role is automated. The software ensures that the shuffle is fair and the deal is accurate, allowing the game to flow smoothly.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;As the dealer, he had the advantage of acting last and could make his betting decision based on everyone else&#039;s actions.&quot;</li><li>&quot;In an online poker game, the dealer role is handled by the software, ensuring a fair and accurate deal.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The dealer shuffled the deck and dealt the cards, starting the new round of poker.&quot;</li></ul>

2) 53 cards (including the joker), often used in ace-to-five lowball and draw high.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.274'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Declaration</h2>
<p>Declaring which share of the pot a player is bidding for in a hi-lo (q.v.) game. Usually done with two coins or chips hidden under the table and then declared - none for the low hand, one for the high hand, both for both the high and low hand.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.275'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Deep Stack</h2>
<p>A deep stack refers to a player having a large amount of chips in a poker game, usually significantly more than the standard beginning stack size. This term is commonly used in both tournaments and cash games, across all possible variants.</p>
<h3>Understanding Deep Stack</h3>
<p>A <b>deep stack</b> in poker refers to a situation where a player has a stack of chips that is considerably larger than the standard starting stack. The exact amount that constitutes a deep stack can vary, but it is generally considered to be at least 200 big blinds in a cash game or tournament. Playing with a deep stack can significantly change the dynamics of the game, as it allows for more strategic play and the potential for larger swings in a player&#039;s chip count.</p>
<h3>Impact of Deep Stack on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Playing with a <b>deep stack</b> can greatly impact a player&#039;s strategy. Because they have more chips at their disposal, deep stack players can be more aggressive and take more risks. They can also play a wider range of hands because they have the chips to back up their plays. However, playing with a deep stack also requires a strong understanding of post-flop play, as many hands with deep stacks go beyond the flop.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Deep Stack&quot;</h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing in a No-limit Hold&#039;em tournament with a starting stack of 1,500 chips. After a few successful plays, you find yourself with a stack of 5,000 chips, while most of the other players at your table have around 1,500 to 2,000 chips. In this situation, you would be considered to have a <b>deep stack</b>.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;John entered the final table as the deep stack, with nearly twice as many chips as the next closest player.&quot;</li><li>&quot;With a deep stack, Mary was able to take more risks and put pressure on her opponents.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite starting as the short stack, Tom managed to build up a deep stack and eventually won the tournament.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.284'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Donk Bet</h2>
<p>A donk bet is a poker term that refers to when a player makes a bet against the previous round&#039;s aggressor out of positional order, usually on the flop. It is generally considered non-standard or weak play since it usually signifies an inexperienced player. However, it can also be used strategically by skilled players.</p>
<h3>Donk Bet Definition and Basic Explanation</h3>
<p>Simply put, a donk bet is a bet made out of the flow of the game. In a typical round of poker, the player who made the last aggressive action (a bet or a raise) in the prior betting round would usually be the first to act in the next betting round. </p>
<p>However, a donk bet is when somebody else leads the betting instead of this player, often indicating that they have a good hand that they want to protect.</p>
<h3>Examples of a Donk Bet in Poker</h3>
<ul><li><b>Flop Scenario:</b> Player A raises pre-flop and Players B and C call. The person who made the last aggressive action pre-flop was Player A, so he would typically be the first to act post-flop. However, Player B, out of position, decides to bet. This is a donk bet.</li><li><b>Turn Scenario:</b> Player A, who was the last aggressor on the flop, expects to be the first to act on the turn. However, Player B, who only called on the flop, suddenly leads with a bet. This is a donk bet.</li></ul>
<h3>Donk Bet Misconceptions and Strategy</h3>
<p>The term &quot;donk&quot; originates from &quot;donkey&quot;, hinting at this bet being a poor or naive play. This is because it undermines positional advantage and can create difficult situations for the bettor. </p>
<p>However, a donk bet doesn&#039;t always have to be bad or a sign of a bad player. A well-executed donk bet can also be used to throw off more experienced opponents or protect a vulnerable hand.</p>

For example, if the flop comes <q class='s'>K</q><q class='d'>T</q><q class='c'>7</q> and a player holds <q class='h'>J</q><q class='h'>9</q>, either a <q class='x'>Q</q> or a <q class='x'>8</q> will complete inside straight draws.

<a name='name.289'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Double Up</h2>
<p>Double up refers to a situation in a poker game where a player doubles their chip stack in a single hand. This term is often used in both tournament and cash game scenarios, across all possible poker variants.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Double Up</h3>
<p>In poker, to <b>double up</b> means to increase your chip stack by an amount equal to its current total. This usually happens when a player with a smaller stack goes all-in and is called by a player with a larger stack. If the player with the smaller stack wins, they double their chips. The exact amount of chips won can vary depending on the game&#039;s blinds and the number of chips the other players have.</p>
<h3>Impact of Double Up on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Doubling up can drastically change a player&#039;s position in the game. A successful <b>double up</b> can take a player from a vulnerable position to a strong one. Conversely, a failed attempt to double up can result in a player losing all their chips and being knocked out of the game. Therefore, the decision to attempt a double up should be made carefully, considering factors like the strength of one&#039;s hand, the behaviour of the other players, and one&#039;s position at the table.</p>
<h3>Example of a Double Up</h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing in a poker tournament and you have 500 chips. You decide to go all-in and another player with 1000 chips decides to call. The cards are dealt and you win the hand. You&#039;ve now doubled your stack to 1000 chips. This is a classic example of a <b>double up</b>.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;After a successful double up, Sarah went from being the short stack to one of the chip leaders.&quot;</li><li>&quot;John decided to go all-in, hoping to double up and get back in the game.&quot;</li><li>&quot;With her last few chips, Mary attempted to double up against the chip leader.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.292'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Down Bet</h2>
<p>A bet on a later round of smaller size than what has been bet previously in the hand. For example, in no-limit hold'em a player raises before the flop to 2,000, then on the flop continues with a &quot;down bet&quot; of 1,000. Down bets counter typical betting patterns since bet sizes more often increase with each round as pots get larger.</p>

<a name='name.298'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Draw</h2>
<p>A draw in poker refers to a situation where a player has a hand that is incomplete and needs further cards to become valuable. The term is used in all poker variants.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Draw</h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>draw</b> or drawing hand refers to a hand that is not yet complete but has the potential to become a very strong hand. The player needs further cards, either from the community cards in games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha, or through further deals or exchanges in games like Five Card Draw. The most common types of draws are straight draws and flush draws.</p>
<h3>Impact of a Draw on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Having a draw can significantly impact a player&#039;s strategy in a poker game. Players often have to decide whether to play aggressively to try to chase their draw (known as <b>drawing</b>) or to play passively to minimize losses if the needed cards don&#039;t come. The decision can depend on factors like the pot odds and implied odds, as well as the player&#039;s read on their opponents&#039; hands.</p>
<h3>Example of a &quot;Draw&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, if you&#039;re playing Texas Hold&#039;em and you have two hearts in your hand and there are two hearts on the flop, you have a flush draw because you need one more heart to complete your flush. This would be a typical situation of a <b>draw</b> in poker.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;With four clubs on the board, John was on a flush draw and needed one more club to complete his hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Mary had an open-ended straight draw, so any of eight cards would complete her straight.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having only a draw, Tom decided to bet aggressively to try to win the pot.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>In poker, a &quot;Drawing Dead&quot; situation occurs when a player is completely unable to win the hand, regardless of the remaining cards to be dealt. Even if the player gets the cards they are hoping for, they still will not have the best hand.</p>
<h3>What is Drawing Dead in Poker?</h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, the term <b>Drawing Dead</b> refers to a scenario where a player has absolutely no chance of winning the hand, regardless of the remaining community cards to be dealt. This term is used across all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, in both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>The situation usually arises when a player is hoping for specific cards to complete their hand, not realizing that even if they get those cards, they would still lose to a better hand held by an opponent.</p>
<h3>Examples of Drawing Dead in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the concept of <b>Drawing Dead</b> in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em game, you&#039;re hoping for a flush draw, but your opponent already has a full house. Even if you get your flush, you still lose the hand.</p>
<p>In an Omaha tournament, you&#039;re drawing to a straight, but unbeknownst to you, your opponent already has a higher straight. Even if you complete your straight, you&#039;re still drawing dead.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Despite hitting his flush on the river, he was drawing dead as his opponent had a full house.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She thought she had a chance with her straight draw, but she was drawing dead against her opponent&#039;s higher straight.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Drawing dead is a situation you want to avoid in poker, as it means you have no chance of winning the hand.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.316'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Dry Board</h2>
<p>A reference to the “texture” of the community cards in hold’em or Omaha.  A “dry board” refers to one in which the community cards do not present many possibilities for drawing hands — e.g., a “rainbow” flop (with three different suits) doesn’t provide a flush draw; disconnected cards do not provide straight draws.  Thus a board of

<q class='c'>Q</q>
<q class='d'>7</q>
<q class='s'>2</q>

would be considered “dry.”  (See also “Wet Board.”)</p>
