<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.320'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Early Position</h2>
<p>Early position in poker refers to being one of the first players to act in a round of betting. This term is typically used in games that use a dealer button, such as Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha.</p>
<h3>Understanding Early Position</h3>
<p>In poker, the <b>early position</b> refers to the seats immediately to the left of the big blind. Players in early position are the first to act in the first round of betting and are said to be &quot;under the gun.&quot; This position is considered challenging because the player has to make a decision with little information about the other players&#039; hands.</p>
<h3>Impact of Early Position on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Being in an <b>early position</b> can significantly impact a player&#039;s strategy. Since players in early position act first, they have to be cautious about which hands they play. Typically, players in early position should play a tighter range of hands compared to those in middle or late position. This is because there are still many players left to act, increasing the likelihood of facing a raise or a re-raise.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Early Position&quot;</h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing a game of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re sitting immediately to the left of the big blind. You&#039;re dealt a hand of 7-2 offsuit, which is generally considered a weak hand. Because you&#039;re in <b>early position</b>, and there are many players left to act after you, it would be wise to fold this hand.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Being in early position, John decided to fold his marginal hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;With a strong hand in early position, Mary decided to raise.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Tom knew that being in early position required a more cautious strategy.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.321'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Edge</h2>
<p>An edge in poker refers to the advantage a player has over their opponents, which can be due to various factors such as skill, experience, or table position. This term is widely used across all poker variants.</p>
<h3>Understanding an Edge</h3>
<p>In poker, an <b>edge</b> refers to a player&#039;s advantage over others. This advantage can come from a variety of sources, such as a player&#039;s skill level, experience, understanding of the game&#039;s strategy, ability to read opponents, table position, or even psychological factors. Having an edge doesn&#039;t guarantee a win in a particular hand or game, but it increases the player&#039;s chances of winning over the long run.</p>
<h3>Impact of an Edge on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Having an edge can significantly affect a player&#039;s strategy in a poker game. Players who believe they have an <b>edge</b> over their opponents might play more aggressively and participate in more hands. Conversely, players who feel they are at a disadvantage might play more conservatively. It&#039;s important for players to accurately assess their edge and adjust their strategy accordingly.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Edge&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, if a highly experienced player is participating in a poker game with beginners, the experienced player likely has a significant edge due to their understanding of strategy and ability to read their opponents&#039; behavior. This <b>edge</b> might influence the experienced player to play more hands and make more aggressive bets.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Despite the randomness of the cards dealt, John&#039;s understanding of odds and probabilities gave him an edge over less experienced players.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Mary knew that her ability to read her opponents&#039; emotions gave her an edge in close games.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Tom acknowledged that the professional player had an edge, but he was determined to play his best game.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.324'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Effective Stack</h2>
<p>A term used to refer to the actual amount of chips being played for between two opponents with unequal stacks.  For example, if one player has 10,000 chips and another only 5,500 chips, the most either player can win from the other in the hand is 5,500.  Thus are the two described as playing “effective stacks” of 5,500 when pitted in a hand against each other.</p>

<p>An entry fee is usually payable for all tournaments (unless they are freerolls) these may be as little as a few cents or as large as thousands of dollars.</p>
<div><b>Usage:</b> <p>A Party Poker <i>entry fee</i> may look something like this:</p>

<a name='name.333'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Equity</h2>
<p>Equity in poker refers to a player&#039;s expected share of the pot, given the current situation in the hand. This term is widely used in all forms of poker, and understanding it is key to making informed betting decisions.</p>
<h3>Understanding Equity</h3>
<p>In poker, <b>equity</b> refers to the expected value a player has in a particular hand at any given moment. It&#039;s a way of assessing how likely a player is to win the hand based on the current cards. Equity is usually expressed as a percentage, with 100% equity meaning a guaranteed win and 0% equity meaning no chance of winning.</p>
<h3>Impact of Equity on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Understanding and calculating <b>equity</b> can significantly influence a player&#039;s decision-making process in a poker game. It helps determine whether a call, fold, or raise is the most profitable action in the long run. Players who accurately calculate their equity and make decisions based on it are more likely to make profitable plays over time.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Equity&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, if you&#039;re playing Texas Hold&#039;em and after the flop you have a flush draw, you have about a 35% equity to win the hand by the river, assuming your opponent does not hold cards that could improve their hand. This <b>equity</b> can influence whether you decide to call a bet, raise, or fold.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;With his flush draw, John knew he had sufficient equity to call his opponent&#039;s bet.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Mary calculated her hand&#039;s equity and decided that folding was the best option.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having low equity in the hand, Tom decided to bluff and bet aggressively.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.336'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Even Money</h2>
<p>A wager made in hopes of earning the amount that was wagered.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.337'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Expectation</h2>
<p>1. A term referring to the amount of you expect to gain on average if you make a certain play. For instance, suppose you put $10 into a $50 pot to draw at a hand that you will make 25% of the time, and it will win every time you make it. Three out of four times, you do not make your draw, and lose $10 each time for a total of $30. The fourth time, you will make your draw, winning $50. Your total gain over those four average hands is $50-$30 = $20, an average of $5 per hand. Thus calling the $10 has a positive expectation of $5. <br/>
2. The amount you expect to make at the poker table in a specific time period. Perhaps in 100 hours play, you have won $527. Then your expectation is $5.27/hr. Of course, you won't make that exact amount each hour (and some hours you will lose), but it's one measure of your anticipated earnings.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.338'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Expected Value (EV)</h2>
<p>In poker, &quot;Expected Value&quot; (EV) is a concept used to measure the profitability of decisions over the long run. It&#039;s a statistical measure of the average amount a certain play will win or lose.</p>
<h3>What is Expected Value in Poker?</h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, <b>Expected Value</b> (often abbreviated as EV) is a fundamental concept used to evaluate the potential profitability of decisions over the long run. This term is relevant across all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, and applies to both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>Expected Value isn&#039;t about individual results or hands; instead, it&#039;s a statistical measure of how much a player can expect to win or lose on average over time if they made the same decision in the same situation repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Examples of Expected Value in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the concept of <b>Expected Value</b> in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em game, you have the opportunity to call a $20 bet to win a $100 pot. If you believe your chances of winning the hand are greater than 20%, your call has a positive expected value.</p>
<p>In an Omaha tournament, you&#039;re facing a large all-in bet. If you believe your hand is a significant underdog against your opponent&#039;s range of hands, calling the bet would have a negative expected value.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;By calculating the expected value, she realized that calling the bet would be profitable in the long run.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite losing the hand, his decision to call had a positive expected value and was the correct play statistically.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Understanding expected value is key to making profitable decisions in poker.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.339'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Exploitative Play</h2>
<p>In poker, &quot;Exploitative Play&quot; refers to a strategy that seeks to take advantage of opponents&#039; weaknesses and tendencies. This approach involves deviating from theoretically optimal play to maximize profit against specific players.</p>
<h3>Understanding Exploitative Play in Poker </h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, <b>Exploitative Play</b> is a strategy where a player deviates from the theoretically optimal strategy to take advantage of the specific weaknesses and tendencies of their opponents. This strategy is used across all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, and applies to both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>Exploitative play involves careful observation and analysis of opponents&#039; habits, such as their betting patterns, their reactions to different situations, and any &quot;tells&quot; they may have, and then adjusting your strategy to exploit these habits.</p>
<h3>Examples of Exploitative Play in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the concept of <b>Exploitative Play</b> in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em game, you notice an opponent frequently over-bets when they have a strong hand. Next time they over-bet, you can exploit this tendency by folding weaker hands you might otherwise call with.</p>
<p>In an Omaha tournament, you observe that a player tends to bluff too often. You exploit this by calling or raising with hands you might typically fold, knowing there&#039;s a good chance your opponent is bluffing.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;By observing his opponent&#039;s habits, he was able to use exploitative play to win more pots.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She noticed her opponent was bluffing too often and exploited this tendency by calling with weaker hands.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Exploitative play is a powerful strategy that can lead to significant profits in poker if used correctly.&quot;</li></ul>
