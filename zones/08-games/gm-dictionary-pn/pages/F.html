<a name='name.345'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Family Pot</h2>
<p>A family pot in poker refers to a situation where most or all players at the table are involved in a particular hand. This term is used across all poker variants.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Family Pot</h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>family pot</b> is a situation where most or all of the players at the table decide to participate in a hand by calling the initial bet. Family pots are relatively rare, especially in games with many players, because the likelihood of each player having a hand they consider good enough to play decreases with the number of players.</p>
<h3>Impact of a Family Pot on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Being in a <b>family pot</b> can significantly affect a player&#039;s strategy. In these situations, the pot is typically larger due to the number of players involved, but the odds of having the best hand are lower. Therefore, players usually need a stronger hand to participate in a family pot. Additionally, bluffing is often less effective in family pots due to the number of players involved.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Family Pot&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em with eight players at the table, if each player decides to call the initial bet and see the flop, this would be considered a family pot. In this situation, each player would need to consider the strength of their hand against a larger number of opponents.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>[] &quot;In the rare occurrence of a family pot, John decided to play cautiously due to the increased competition.&quot;<br/>
[] &quot;Despite the family pot, Mary decided to bluff, hoping the other players would fold.&quot;</p></li><li>&quot;Tom knew that the odds were against him in the family pot, but he decided to take the risk because of the large potential payout.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.347'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Fast Play</h2>
<p>&#039;Fast Play&#039; in poker refers to a strategy where a player bets aggressively with a strong hand rather than playing slowly or passively. This approach is often used when a player wants to build the pot or eliminate opponents from the hand.</p>
<h3>What is Fast Play in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, the term &#039;Fast Play&#039; is used to describe a strategy where a player bets or raises aggressively when they have a strong hand. This is the opposite of slow playing, where a player with a strong hand plays passively to disguise the strength of their hand and induce their opponents to bet more.</p>
<h3>The Strategy of Fast Playing </h3>
<p>The decision to fast play a hand depends on several factors, including the strength of the player&#039;s hand, the number of opponents in the hand, and the player&#039;s position at the table.</p>
<p>Fast playing is often used when a player has a strong hand and wants to build the pot. By betting and raising, the player encourages their opponents to put more money into the pot. This strategy can be particularly effective if the player believes their opponents will call their bets.</p>
<p>Fast playing can also be used as a defensive strategy to limit the number of opponents in the hand. By betting aggressively, the player can force their opponents to fold, reducing the risk of an opponent drawing out on them.</p>
<h3>When to Fast Play </h3>
<p>The decision to fast play a hand should be based on the specific circumstances of the hand. Here are some situations where fast playing might be the best strategy:<br/>
You have a strong hand and you believe your opponent will call if you bet.<br/>
You&#039;re in a late position and several players have already called the blinds.<br/>
The board is likely to help your opponents improve their hands on the turn or river.<br/>
You want to protect your hand against potential draws.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Fast Play&quot; </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt a pair of aces. The flop comes and you hit a set. Instead of slow playing your hand, you decide to fast play to build the pot. You make a large bet, and your opponent, who has hit a pair on the flop, decides to call.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;With a flush on the flop, she decided to fast play her hand and made a large bet.&quot;</li><li>&quot;He fast played his set on the flop to protect against potential straight and flush draws.&quot;</li><li>&quot;After hitting a full house on the turn, she decided to fast play to build the pot.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.348'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Feeler Bet</h2>
<p>Similar to a &quot;blocking bet,&quot; a &quot;feeler bet&quot; is usually a small, leading bet made after the flop. However, while a blocking bet is often made late in the hand (e.g., on the river) explicitly to prevent an opponent from betting larger, a feeler bet is generally a less specific attempt to gather information from how others respond. Sometimes called a &quot;probe bet.&quot;</p>

<a name='name.352'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Fish</h2>
<p>A player who loses money. An old saying is &quot;If you can&#039;t spot the fish at the table, *you* are the fish.&quot;</p>
<h3>Fish Definition: What is a Fish in Poker? </h3>
<p>A fish in poker is defined as a losing player that is typically inexperienced or not skilled in the game. The term is therefore considered derogatory, so you shouldn’t call an opponent this, as some players do, to berate and insult. </p>
<h4>Examples of fish used in a sentence </h4>
<ul><li>&#039;My opponent is a fish because they called a re-raise preflop with 64 offsuit.&#039;</li><li>&#039;I joined this cash game as there are a lot of fish at the table.&#039;</li><li>&#039;Fish are weak or inexperienced players that can be exploited in poker.&#039;</li></ul>
<h4>How to Spot a Fish in Poker - 5 ways to find a Fish</h4>
<p>You now might know what a fish is, but actually spotting them at the poker table is a different challenge. Here are 5 ways to spot a fish in poker. </p>
<h5>A fish will… limp a lot </h5>
<p>Typically, you don’t want to enter a pot by just calling. Of course, there are exceptions, but for the most part limping (just calling preflop in an unraised pot) is not the optimum strategy. This is because you’ll get raised a lot, and if your hand was not good enough to raise in the first place it’s unlikely going to be good enough to call a raise - so you’re putting money into the pot and not seeing a flop. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you do have a strong hand and just limp in, you’re potentially losing value preflop and also giving your opponents a chance to catch up with you with a weaker hand by seeing the flop for free.</p>
<p>If you see a player limping a lot, specifically from an early position, it’s a safe bet that they’re a fish. </p>
<h5>A fish will… play out of position</h5>
<p>Position is key in poker. One of the easiest quick fixes to your game that will help you improve drastically is learning about position. Position refers to which players’ turn it is to act, with early positions at a disadvantage by having to act (Eg. fold, call or raise) first, while the blinds have the advantage of acting last.</p>
<p>The advantage of playing in position is significant, but something that fish, to their detriment, will consistently overlook.</p>
<h5>A fish will… call light </h5>
<p>One main reason why it’s important to spot a fish is that you can get more value from them. Weaker players overvalue their own hands and don’t think through what their opponents might have. Any big bet they face, they might think they’re being bluffed even if it’s a logical large value bet, and call off with a mediocre hand - not wanting to get bluffed off the pot. Fish have a tougher time laying down hands in general and when they do hit a decent hand, will massively overplay them regardless of what their opponent could or could not have. </p>
<p>Look for the players that love calling multiple street bets or call off the river with weak hands - they&#039;re likely fish. </p>
<h5>A fish will… go on tilt</h5>
<p>Apart from the obvious one or two exceptions, Phil Hellmuth we’re looking at you here, most profitable poker players understand that going on tilt and allowing anger/frustration to impact your play is seriously going to affect your win rate. Good players realise that variance dictates that being sucked out on and losing hands from a dominant position when your opponent hits their miracle card is all part of the game. </p>
<p>However, how do you spot if another player is on tilt? A key indicator is that they will take to the keyboard to call their opponent a fish, donkey or [insert any other relevant poker slur here] when they lose. As mentioned, good players might be frustrated when their opponent calls light and hits their miracle out, but they understand it’s part of variance and that their opponent will likely lose in the long run if they keep playing the same way. </p>
<p>So, if you see a player at your table constantly reacting to bad beats and seemingly not understanding why they got sucked out on, it’s likely that their grasp of the game is limited and they’re a potential fish, ready to be exploited.</p>
<h5>A fish places weird bet sizes </h5>
<p>Poor players do not know the optimum bet sizes to make to get called with their strong hands and folds with their weak hands. For instance, a standard preflop raise is somewhere between 2 and 4 big blinds. A fish might look down at pocket aces and raise to 10 big blinds. Similarly, in a tournament, they might have a monster preflop and shove all-in with 50+ big blinds. </p>
<p>While some of the previous tips are somewhat more subtle, this type of fish behaviour is far more obvious and noticeable. </p>
<h3>How to Exploit a Fish in Poker</h3>
<p>Okay, so you know what a fish is and you know how to spot them at the poker table, but the next (and perhaps most important) step is learning how to take advantage of the situation. Here’s how to exploit a fish in poker.</p>
<h4>Bet big vs fish</h4>
<p>Weak players do not want to fold their hands. If they have aces, even with their limited knowledge of the game, they know that this is the best hand in NLH, and while aces are the nuts preflop, things change when the cards come. By the river, you should definitely be playing the board rather than your hand. For instance, aces are very strong preflop but if the river comes and shows a four-card straight on the board, the strength of the aces becomes diluted. </p>
<p>However, fish will just see that they have aces, associate them with great strength preflop and find it tough to fold them, regardless of how the community cards fall. </p>
<p>So, while slow playing sometimes has its value in certain scenarios, if you have a good hand and strongly believe it’s the best hand, bet - bet - bet and take your opponent to value town.</p>
<h4>Get into pots v fish </h4>
<p>As we defined, a fish is a weak poker player, so you want to try to play as many pots as you can against fish. This sounds obvious, but if you have a mediocre hand preflop and are not sure whether to enter into the pot or fold, it might be worth laying it down if you’re facing a strong opponent, saving your chips to battle against the fish.</p>
<p>Fish are far more likely to make mistakes that you can capitalise on, and are a lot less likely to give you tough decisions in later streets. It’s also more likely you’ll be able to run them over in latter streets, so it’s worth taking them into deep waters where you feel far more comfortable than they do.</p>
<h4>Understand raising actions </h4>
<p>Fish will rarely 3 or 4-bet bluff preflop. If you’ve ever played low stakes, the amount of 3-betting and 4-betting that happens pre is very limited. When it does happen, more often than not the raiser has a monster. </p>
<p>So, if you’re against a fish and find yourself facing an ultra-aggressive re-raise preflop, just question how often they do this. It could be that they are just a loose-aggressive player who 3-bets 94 suited, but the majority of the time they will be betting strong with strength. </p>
<p>It’s not just about preflop action though. If a fish shoves all-in on the streets for 50bbs, this says a lot about their play. Again, they could just be loose and shoving with nothing, but more likely they’ve made their hand and don’t know the best way to extract value. </p>
<p>While exploiting fish is largely about extracting value from them, it’s also important to follow the advice above, not go chasing profit and know when to lay down your hand.</p>
<h3>Fish vs Donkey - What’s the Difference?</h3>
<p>There is little difference between the terms fish and donkey in poker. Both are derogatory and both are used to describe weak and inexperienced players. One way the two terms vary slightly is that a donkey is a general slur that can be used in everyday life, whereas fish is only ever used in this context at the tables.  </p>
<h3>Is it Rude to Call Someone a Fish in Poker?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is rude to call someone a fish. Regardless of how bad they’ve played or how annoyed you are, it’s never acceptable to call an opponent a fish in anger. It’s not exactly illegal, but it’s up for interpretation and some poker rooms may see it as abusive behaviour towards other players and therefore penalise or take action against you. </p>
<h3>How do you Stop Being a Fish in Poker? </h3>
<p>There are no shortcuts or easy workarounds - to stop being a fish in poker you have to study and learn more about the game. </p>
<p>If you’ve identified the fact that you’re a fish, that’s a big and very important step. People’s egos combined with the Lake Wobegon Effect (humans’ tendency to overestimate their ability at something) means most players that actually are fish don’t know or think they are. This is problematic, as if you think you’re a good player when you’re not, you’re unlikely to change the way you play and improve as you don’t realise you are doing anything wrong.</p>
<p><b>Learn Preflop Ranges</b><br/>
So, if you know you’re a losing player, the good thing is that you can change it. To do this, start from the basics. Learn your opening ranges - I.e. what hands you should raise preflop in each position. Many players, some even more experienced, think they know exactly what hands to play and in what position, then are hugely surprised when they see the GTO raise charts. </p>

<p>Playing the correct ranges preflop is essential to playing solid poker strategy. It will give you the foundations to build on to become a better, profitable poker player. </p>
<p><b>Don’t Chase Draws </b><br/>
A draw in poker is where you’re waiting on certain cards on later streets to complete a flush or a straight. Flushes and straights are strong hands and hitting these will usually mean you’ll win the pot - and win a big pot at that if your opponent has a weaker hand that is still deeper enough to call with. </p>
<p>For this reason, fish usually try too hard to make their draws, meaning they call bets with weak or no made hand at all far too often in the hope of hitting their cards. While you shouldn’t fold your draws all the time, experienced players will realise the situations where you shouldn’t chase and lay their hand down. Sure, this means they won’t potentially hit their flushes/straights, but it saves them the money of paying off turn or river bets to hope to see the required cards come. In the long run, it’s profitable. </p>
<p>So, when should you chase your draws? Luckily, poker is not a game of blind luck and random judgement. Using mathematical theory and precision, it’s simple to work out when to fold your draws. The equation is shown below: </p>
<h5>Equation to calculate your equity on the flop</h5>
<p>Number of Outs x 4 = Equity (%)</p>
<h5>Equation to calculate your equity on the turn</h5>
<p>Number of Outs x 2 + Equity (%) </p>
<p>Here, an ‘out’ is a card that will likely make your hand stronger than your opponents - E.g. the river card makes your flush or straight. </p>
<p>For instance, if you have a diamond flush draw on the flop, assuming your opponent is ahead you’ll have 9 outs to hit your flush. This is because there are 13 diamonds in the deck, two are in your hand and two are from the community cards on the flop. Times those 9 outs by 4 means you have 36% equity in this hand on the flop. So, if you’re facing a raise where you only have to put in 20% of the total pot and your equity is 36%, then it is +EV to call and calling to try to hit your flush is the optimum play. </p>
<p><b>Be More Critical of your Game</b><br/>
It’s easier said than done, but any pro player will tell you to leave your ego at the door when it comes to poker. Far too many weak, losing players will fail to accept their own mistakes they’ve made when they play. These are leaks in their game that need to be addressed to become profitable, but never will be. </p>
<p>A general, common example is when a player gets sucked out on on the river - I.e. they are a huge favourite on the turn but their opponent hits one of very few outs to make the best hand on the river. If your opponent hits their one out on the river against you, it is unlucky and you can blame losing the pot on the poker Gods for not blessing you with luck that day. And sure, it is unlucky, but what happened before the river? </p>
<p>Just because they got unlucky, bad players will assume it’s 100% down to luck as to why they lost their money. But, what mistakes were made preflop or on the streets? Good players are always self-critical, and win or lose will look back over how they played hands and determine what mistakes were made - AND more importantly, learn from them. </p>
<p><b>Get your Raise Sizes Right </b><br/>
Getting your raise sizes right can be the difference between being a losing player and being profitable. If you’re always pricing out your opponents when you have the nuts, you’re losing out on value. Equally, if you’re not charging your opponents enough with your bluffs, you can give them too cheap of a price meaning it’s +EV for them to call you down. </p>
<p>Even the most seasoned of pros will never raise the optimum size every hand, but it’s important to understand the value of raising the right sizes and how important it can be to your profitability. </p>
<p>Firstly, it’s crucial to know why you’re betting. It sounds stupid, but often fish will raise not knowing whether they are in fact bluffing or raising for value. To determine which one it is, you need to evaluate your hand and compare it to what you think your opponent is most likely to have. This is where ranges come into play. If your opponent has 4-bet you preflop, it’s likely they either have complete bluffs or the top of their range. Therefore, if you hit trip deuces on the flop, it’s very likely that you’ll be ahead in the hand, BUT more importantly, your opponent should have strong enough equity to call a flop bet. Therefore, betting big on the flop for value is safe as your opponent will want to continue with his strong holding. </p>
<p>On the other hand, in the same situation if the Villain in the hand just calls a min-raise open in the BB, their range will be very wide. Therefore, you are unlikely to have your big value bet on the flop called, so should potentially go for a smaller sizing depending on the exact cards of the flop. </p>
<p>It’s these fine margins that are so crucial in poker.</p>

<a name='name.360'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Flat Call</h2>
<p>A flat call in poker refers to a situation where a player chooses to call a bet without raising. This term is commonly used in all poker variants.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Flat Call</h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>flat call</b> refers to when a player decides to simply call a bet without choosing to raise. This action is often used when a player has a good, but not great, hand and wants to see more cards without escalating the pot. A flat call can also be used as part of a strategic move to disguise the strength of a player&#039;s hand or to trap an aggressive opponent.</p>
<h3>Impact of a Flat Call on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Making a <b>flat call</b> can significantly influence a player&#039;s strategy in a poker game. By flat calling, a player can control the pot size, keep the betting round open, and potentially induce bluffs from aggressive opponents. However, it can also allow opponents with weaker hands to see more cards and possibly improve their hands.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Flat Call&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em, if a player is dealt a pair of Jacks and an opponent raises before the flop, the player might choose to flat call. This decision to <b>flat call</b> could be made to avoid a re-raise from their opponent or to disguise the strength of their hand.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;John decided to flat call to control the pot size and see the next card.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Mary made a flat call with her strong hand to disguise its strength and induce a bluff from her opponent.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a strong hand, Tom decided to flat call to avoid escalating the pot.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.362'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Float</h2>
<p>Here&#039;s everything you need to know about a Float in poker - the act of calling with a weak hand with the intention of improving on later streets.</p>
<h3>What is a Float in Poker? </h3>
<p>In the world of poker, the term &#039;<b>Float</b>&#039; refers to a strategic move where a player calls a bet without a strong hand, with the intention to take down the pot on a later street. This play is often used to bluff opponents and is typically executed on the flop or turn in <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b> and <b>Pot Limit Omaha</b> games.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Concept of Float </h3>
<p>A float is a <b>bluffing technique</b> used by poker players to confuse their opponents and control the pot. When a player decides to float, they are making a call with a weak hand or even no hand at all, hoping to take control of the hand on a later street. The key to a successful float is understanding your opponent&#039;s tendencies and being able to predict their future actions.</p>
<p>It&#039;s important to note that floating is a more advanced strategy and requires a solid understanding of poker dynamics. It&#039;s not a move that should be used randomly or without careful consideration.</p>
<h3>When to Use a Float </h3>
<p>Floating is typically used in <b>position</b>, and it&#039;s most effective against opponents who frequently make continuation bets but often fail to follow through on the turn or river. By calling their bet on the flop, you can put pressure on them by betting or raising if they show weakness on a later street.</p>
<p>However, floating can also be a risky strategy. If your opponent is aggressive and likely to continue betting on the turn and river, or if they have a strong hand, your float could end up being costly.</p>
<h3>Examples of a &quot;Float&quot; </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and the flop comes down. Your hand isn&#039;t strong, but you suspect your opponent might be making a continuation bet with a weak hand. Instead of folding, you decide to call – this is a float.</p>
<p>On the turn, your opponent checks, indicating weakness. You now make a bet, using your position and your opponent&#039;s perceived weakness to try to take down the pot.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He didn&#039;t have a strong hand, but he decided to float the flop and take away the pot on the turn.&quot;</li><li>&quot;After floating the flop, she managed to bluff her way to winning the hand on the river.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having no hand, he used a float strategy to take control and win the pot.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.364'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Flop</h2>
<p>The flop in poker refers to the first three community cards that are dealt face-up on the table. This term is typically used in community card poker games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Flop</h3>
<p>In poker, the <b>flop</b> refers to the first three community cards that are dealt face-up on the table. These cards are shared by all players in games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha. The flop is preceded by a round of betting and followed by another round of betting.</p>
<h3>Impact of the Flop on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>The <b>flop</b> significantly influences a player&#039;s strategy in a poker game. It provides key information about how a player&#039;s hand compares to possible hands of their opponents. The strength of a player&#039;s hand relative to the flop, and how the flop might have improved their opponents&#039; hands, usually determines whether a player decides to bet, call, raise, or fold.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Flop&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em, if a player is dealt two hearts and the flop contains two additional hearts, the player has a flush draw and may decide to bet or raise. The <b>flop</b> has significantly influenced this decision by improving the potential strength of the player&#039;s hand.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;John, with a pair of Queens, was pleased when another Queen appeared on the flop.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having two Aces, Mary was concerned when the flop showed three consecutive suited cards.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The flop didn&#039;t improve Tom&#039;s hand, so he decided to check and see the next card.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.367'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Flush</h2>
<p>A flush in poker refers to a hand where all five cards are of the same suit but not in numerical sequence. This term is used across all poker variants.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Flush</h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>flush</b> is a hand where all five cards are of the same suit, but not in numerical order. If they were in order, the hand would be a straight flush, which ranks higher. The highest possible flush is an Ace-high flush, also known as a &quot;nut flush,&quot; and the lowest is a 2-3-4-5-7 of the same suit.</p>
<h3>Impact of a Flush on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Having a <b>flush</b> can significantly affect a player&#039;s strategy in a poker game. It&#039;s a strong hand that often leads to winning the pot. However, the player needs to consider the possibility of opponents having a higher flush or a full house. In games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha, where flushes are more common due to the community cards, players should be cautious when betting aggressively with a low or middle flush.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Flush&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em, if a player has two hearts in their hand and there are three more hearts among the community cards, they have a flush. The player&#039;s decision to bet, call, raise, or fold will be significantly influenced by this <b>flush</b>.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;John was thrilled when he realized he had a flush and decided to raise the bet.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Mary had a low flush and decided to call rather than raise, fearing her opponent might have a higher flush.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a flush, Tom decided to fold when his opponent made a large bet, suspecting they might have a full house.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.369'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Fold</h2>
<p>A &#039;<b>Fold</b>&#039; in poker refers to the act of surrendering one&#039;s hand and forfeiting any interest in the current pot. By folding, a player avoids incurring additional losses when they believe their hand is unlikely to win.</p>
<h3>What is a Fold in Poker? </h3>
<p>The term &#039;<b>Fold</b>&#039; in poker is used when a player decides to lay down their cards and withdraw from the current round of play. This action is typically chosen when a player believes their hand is weaker than their opponents&#039; or when the cost to continue playing the hand is too high. When a player folds, they lose any chips they have already put into the pot during the current round.</p>
<h3>The Strategy of Folding </h3>
<p>Knowing when to fold is a crucial part of poker strategy. It&#039;s often said that poker is a game of skill and understanding when to hold &#039;em and when to fold &#039;em is a big part of that skill.</p>
<p>While folding a hand means giving up a chance at the pot, it also means avoiding additional losses. A player who knows when to fold can save their chips for when they have a stronger hand, thereby managing their chip stack more effectively over the course of a game or tournament.</p>
<h3>The Impact of Folding on the Game </h3>
<p>Folding not only impacts your own chip stack but also the dynamics of the game. By folding, you reduce the number of active players, which can impact the strategies of the remaining players. Additionally, a player who folds often may develop a tight image, which can affect how other players perceive and play against them.</p>
<h3>Example of a &quot;Fold&quot; </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt a weak hand. The player before you puts in a large bet. You don&#039;t think your hand is strong enough to win, so instead of matching the bet, you decide to fold.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Seeing the high bet from his opponent, he decided to fold his weak hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She knew she couldn&#039;t bluff her way out of this one, so she decided to fold.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having put a significant amount of chips in the pot, he chose to fold when the stakes got too high.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.370'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Fold Equity</h2>
<p>A term referring specifically to the amount of equity a player gains from likelihood of an opponent folding to a bet. If a player pushes all in against a single opponent, that player’s “equity” includes both the money he will win should his opponent call and his hand prove best and the money he will win should his opponent fold to his bet. The latter portion is his “fold equity.”</p>
<p>While fold equity can be calculated specifically, the term is most often used in a much less precise way to refer broadly to the probability of getting a player to fold when betting. For example, in a tournament if a player open-raises all in with a 20-big blind stack, that player has a better chance of getting others to fold than if he pushes all in with just 5 big blinds. Thus with the larger stack, the player is said to have more “fold equity” when shoving.</p>

<a name='name.380'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Freeroll</h2>
<p>A &#039;Freeroll&#039; in poker refers to a tournament that is free to enter but still offers real money prizes or other valuable rewards. These tournaments are often used by poker sites to attract new players or reward loyal customers.</p>
<h3>What is a Freeroll in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Freeroll&#039; is a tournament that players can enter for free, with no buy-in or entry fee required. Despite the free entry, freerolls still offer real money prizes, tickets to other tournaments, or other types of rewards. They&#039;re commonly offered by online poker sites as a way to attract new players, reward existing players, or as part of special promotions.</p>
<h3>The Benefits of Playing Freerolls </h3>
<p>Freerolls provide an excellent opportunity for players, especially beginners, to gain tournament experience without risking any of their own money. They allow players to practice their skills, learn tournament strategy, and get a feel for the pace and structure of tournament play.</p>
<p>For more experienced players, freerolls can offer the chance to build a poker bankroll from scratch. While the prize pools for freerolls are typically not as large as those for paid tournaments, they still provide an opportunity to win real money without any financial investment.</p>
<h3>Strategies for Playing Freerolls </h3>
<p>Playing in freeroll tournaments can be a bit different from regular tournaments due to the large number of players and the often more aggressive play. Here are a few strategy tips for playing freerolls:<br/>
Be patient: Many players in freerolls play very loosely, especially in the early stages. Being patient and waiting for strong hands can be a good strategy.<br/>
Play aggressively with strong hands: When you do get a strong hand, don&#039;t be afraid to play it aggressively. Many of your opponents will be willing to call with weaker hands.<br/>
Pay attention to your opponents: Try to identify which players are playing loosely and which are playing more conservatively. This information can help you make better decisions as the tournament progresses.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Freeroll&quot; </h3>
<p>An online poker site might run a weekly freeroll tournament with a $1,000 prize pool. Players can enter the tournament for free and compete for their share of the $1,000.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;She entered the freeroll tournament and managed to finish in the top 10, winning a small cash prize.&quot;</li><li>&quot;As a new player on the site, he was eligible to play in a special freeroll with a $5,000 prize pool.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite the large field of players in the freeroll, she played patiently and made it to the final table.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.381'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Freezeout</h2>
<p>A freezeout in poker refers to a tournament format where players start with a set amount of chips and continue to play until they run out of chips, at which point they are eliminated. This term is used in the context of poker tournaments.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Freezeout</h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>freezeout</b> is a type of tournament where each player begins with a specified amount of chips. When a player loses all their chips, they are eliminated from the tournament. Unlike in rebuy tournaments, players are not allowed to buy more chips and re-enter the tournament once they&#039;re out.</p>
<h3>Impact of a Freezeout on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Playing in a <b>freezeout</b> tournament influences a player&#039;s strategy significantly. Since players cannot buy back into the tournament, they often adopt a more conservative approach, especially in the early stages. It&#039;s crucial to manage one&#039;s chip stack effectively and make calculated decisions to avoid early elimination.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Freezeout&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, in a freezeout tournament with a $100 buy-in, each player might start with 10,000 chips. If a player loses all their chips, they cannot buy back in and must leave the tournament. The player&#039;s strategy in this <b>freezeout</b> tournament would involve careful chip management and risk assessment.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;John played conservatively in the early stages of the freezeout tournament to preserve his chip stack.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Mary took a calculated risk in the freezeout tournament, understanding that she couldn&#039;t buy back in if she lost all her chips.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Tom was eliminated early from the freezeout tournament after a few bad hands.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.385'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Full House</h2>
<h3>What makes a full house in poker?</h3>
<p><b>A <i>Full House</i> is any three cards of the same number or face value</b>, plus any other two cards of the same number or face value. An example of a full house is <q class='s'>A</q><q class='d'>A</q><q class='c'>A</q><q class='h'>6</q><q class='c'>6</q>, but <q class='c'>2</q><q class='d'>2</q><q class='h'>2</q><q class='s'>3</q><q class='c'>3</q> is a full house as well.</p>
<p>For you to be able to <b>have a full house in no-limit</b> texas hold'em poker, there always needs to be at least one pair on the board. Since you only have 2 cards in your hand, and you need to make three-of-a-kind ánd a pair, there needs to be at least two of the same value cards on the table.</p>
<h3>An Example of Full house:</h3>
<p>The following five community cards are on the table: <q class='h'>4</q><q class='d'>8</q><q class='d'>9</q><q class='s'>J</q><q class='c'>4</q></p>
<p><b>Phil Ivey</b> has <q class='s'>4</q><q class='h'>J</q> in his hand, he now plays a full house. With the 2 cards his hand, and the 5 on the board, Ivey has 7 cards total to make the best combination of 5 cards. Ivey doesn't use the eight and the nine, and makes <q class='s'>4</q><q class='h'>4</q><q class='c'>4</q><q class='h'>J</q><q class='s'>J</q>; a full house.</p>
<p><b>Daniel Negreanu</b> has <q class='h'>8</q><q class='c'>8</q> in his hand, also have a full house. Negreanu doesn't use 2 of the cards and makes the best combination of five cards. In this case, Negreanu uses <q class='h'>8</q><q class='c'>8</q><q class='d'>8</q><q class='h'>4</q><q class='c'>4</q> to make his full house.</p>
<p><b>The best full house is</b> the one with the highest three-of-a-kind. If you and your opponent(s) have the same three-of-a-kind, you'll look at who has the higher pair to go along with it. The one with the higher pair, than wins the hand. If you have the same three-of-a-kind and pair, you split the pot.</p>
<p>In this example, <b>Negreanu </b>with <q class='h'>8</q><q class='c'>8</q> wins from <b>Ivey </b>with <q class='s'>4</q><q class='h'>J</q>. <q class='h'>8</q><q class='c'>8</q><q class='d'>8</q><q class='h'>4</q><q class='c'>4</q> is higher than the <q class='s'>4</q><q class='h'>4</q><q class='c'>4</q><q class='h'>J</q><q class='s'>J</q> of Ivey, and Negreanu wins the pot. </p>
<p>If you have the <q class='h'>8</q><q class='c'>8</q><q class='d'>8</q><q class='h'>4</q><q class='c'>4</q> full house, you can call it &quot;eights full of fours&quot;. In this expression, you always use the three-of-a-kind first, followed by the pair. Ivey, in this example, had &quot;<b>fours full of jacks</b>&quot;.</p>
<div><b>Usage:</b> <p>&quot;Man, I had a full house right in the first hand of the day! Nobody could beat my aces full of eights, and I scooped a monster!&quot;</p></div>
