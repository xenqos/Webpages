<a name='name.391'>&nbsp;</a><h2>GG</h2>
<p>&quot;GG&quot; has two meanings in the world of poker. </p>
<h3>Good Game</h3>
<p>It's short for &quot;good game,&quot; something poker players traditionally say when they bust from an online tournament, or to someone after they have busted, complimenting their play. It's also said sarcastically, pointing out someone's flawed play or unfortunate bust-out. While the usage of &quot;GG&quot; comes from the online poker world, using it in the table's chat box, it has made its transition into the world of live poker as well, with people pronouncing it as &quot;gee gee.&quot;</p>
<h3>GGnetwork</h3>
<p>GG is also the name of an independent poker network, focused on the Asian poker market. GGnetwork, and one of it's most prominent skins GGpoker, have taken their name from the above-described poker term. Another well-known skin on this poker network, is <b>Natural8</b>.</p>
<div><b>Usage:</b> <p><b>Situation 1:</b><br/>
Player 1: &quot;wow, that was a bad beat!&quot;<br/>
Player 2: &quot;GG man!&quot;<br/>
Player 1: &quot;Thanks man, good luck in the remainder of the tournament.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Situation 2:</b><br/>
Player 1: &quot;Have you played on GG yet? They have a weekly $5k tournament!&quot;<br/>
Player 2: &quot;Yeah, I play on Natural8 every week, it's a really soft site!&quot;</p></div>

<a name='name.398'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Grinder</h2>
<p>A &#039;Grinder&#039; in poker refers to a player who makes a living by regularly playing small and medium stakes poker games and consistently winning small amounts rather than aiming for high stakes games.</p>
<h3>What is a Grinder in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Grinder&#039; is a player who earns their living or a significant amount of their income from playing poker. They tend to play in small to medium stakes games and win money consistently over time, rather than aiming for big wins in high stakes games.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Grinder </h3>
<p>Grinders are generally very patient, disciplined, and conservative in their playing style. They aim to minimize risk and grind out a profit over the long term. They often play many tables simultaneously and put in a large number of hours to maximize their earnings.</p>
<h3>The Grinder&#039;s Play Style </h3>
<p>A Grinder&#039;s playing style is typically &#039;tight&#039; and &#039;aggressive&#039;. They often play fewer hands than other players but play them aggressively when they do. This conservative approach helps them minimize losses and steadily accumulate winnings over time.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Grinder&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing in an online poker room and you notice a player who is consistently at multiple tables, playing fewer hands but often winning small pots, you might be observing a Grinder.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He was known as a Grinder, steadily accumulating winnings over long hours of play.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She adopted a Grinder&#039;s approach to the game, playing conservatively and patiently to ensure consistent profits.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite the allure of high stakes games, he remained a Grinder, valuing the consistency of smaller, regular wins.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.399'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Grinding</h2>
<p>Playing in a style with minimal risk and modest gains over a long period of time.</p>
<div><b>Usage:</b> <p>Like in sentence &quot;Tony has been <i>grinding</i> away at $5/$10 limit all month&quot;.</p></div>

<a name='name.400'>&nbsp;</a><h2>GTO</h2>
<p>GTO stands for Game Theory Optimal, the optimal way to play a hand or street according to Game Theory. Game Theory, according to Wikipedia, is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers.</p>
<p>Many of the top poker professionals study Game Theory to understand the rationale behind poker. While a GTO approach to the game is unexplitable, it&#039;s not always the optimal way of playing since many opponents don&#039;t play optimal themselves, thus making it optimal to divert from a GTO approach to extract maximum value. </p>
<p>Podcast host Joey Ingram uses the term GTO for far more than just poker hands and poker situations, he uses the term to put value on life decisions and how close they are to being optimal given a rational train of thoughts.</p>

<a name='name.401'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Guarantee</h2>
<p>Refers to a guaranteed prize pool for a tournament as established by the poker room (live or online) hosting the event.  Guarantees help attract players to participate in a tournament as they ensure a minimum prize pool for the event.  If not enough players enter to build the guaranteed prize pool, the poker room must supply the remainder, thus creating an “overlay” for the tournament.</p>

<a name='name.402'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Gut Shot</h2>
<p>To draw to and/or hit an inside straight.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.403'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Gutshot</h2>
<p>A gutshot in poker refers to a type of draw where you have just one (numeric) card as an &#039;out&#039; to hit your straight. For instance, in Hold’em if you hold

<q class='x'>8</q>
<q class='x'>7</q>

and the flop comes

<q class='x'>K</q>
<q class='x'>5</q>
<q class='x'>4</q>
, you have a “gutshot draw” to a straight, needing a

<q class='x'>6</q>

to complete it.</p>

<h3>What is a Gutshot in Poker?</h3>
<p>A gutshot is another term for inside straight draw. In other words, you have four cards of a straight, and the one card needed to complete it sits inside your straight draw. So, let&#039;s say you have

<q class='c'>3</q>
<q class='s'>4</q>

and the flop is

<q class='h'>5</q>
<q class='d'>7</q>
<q class='d'>A</q>

here you will need a six to complete your straight. You have the 3, 4, 5 and 7 part, but the 6 that sits inside the 5 and the 7 is still required. </p>

<p>Gutshots exist in Texas Hold&#039;em, Omaha, Stud and a range of other poker variants. A gutshot is not the same, though, as an open-ended straight draw. Here, you can hit one of two cards to hit your straight - for instance you have

<q class='c'>3</q>
<q class='c'>4</q>

and the flop comes

<q class='h'>5</q>
<q class='h'>6</q>
<q class='d'>K</q>
. In this case, you can hit either a 2 or a 7 to complete your straight.</p>

<h3>Examples of Gutshot in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the concept of a <b>Gutshot</b> in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em game, you hold 5-6 and the flop comes 3-4-K. You now have a gutshot, needing a 2 to complete the straight.</p>
<p>In an Omaha tournament, you hold A-2-3-5 and the flop comes 4-6-7. You have a gutshot with a 5 needed to complete the straight.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Despite having a gutshot, he decided to fold due to the poor odds of completing his hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She hit her gutshot on the river, completing her straight and winning a large pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Chasing a gutshot can be risky as there are fewer cards that can complete your hand compared to an open-ended straight draw.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.404'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Gutshot Straight</h2>
<p>An straight filled &quot;inside&quot;. If you have 9s-8s, the flop comes 7c-5h-2d, and the turn is the 6c, you've made your gutshot straight. </p>
