<a name='name.405'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Hand</h2>
<p>A &#039;Hand&#039; in poker refers to the set of cards held by a player during a round of poker. It can also refer to the entire course of action from the dealing of cards till the revealing of the winner.</p>
<h3>What is a Hand in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Hand&#039; has two meanings. It can refer to the set of cards held by a player during a round of poker. Alternatively, it can refer to the entire course of a round of poker from the dealing of the initial cards till the revealing of the winner.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Poker Hand </h3>
<p>Understanding the value of a poker hand is crucial to playing the game. Poker hands are ranked based on the likelihood of receiving them, with the rarest hands being the strongest. The number of cards in a hand can vary depending on the poker variant, but is typically five.</p>
<h3>The Course of a Poker Hand </h3>
<p>When referring to a round of play, a poker hand involves several stages including the dealing of cards, betting rounds, and finally, the showdown where the winner is determined.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Hand&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt an Ace and a King, that&#039;s your starting hand. The entire round of betting and subsequent card dealing is also referred to as a hand.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He looked at his hand and saw he&#039;d been dealt a pair of aces.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She played the hand perfectly and managed to win a large pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a strong hand, he decided to fold as he suspected his opponent had a straight flush.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.406'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Hand-for-Hand</h2>
<p>“Hand-for-hand” play is instituted in multi-table tournaments, often just before the money bubble bursts and payouts begin, or after the tournament is in the money and just before another pay jump occurs. Hand-for-hand play means each remaining table much complete a single hand before the next one is dealt, thereby ensuring all tables play the same number of hands before the next elimination occurs. </p>
<p>Hand-for-hand play helps prevent players from stalling in order to slow down their table in the hopes an elimination occurs at another, faster-playing table.</p>

<a name='name.408'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Heads Up</h2>
<p>Heads-up in poker refers to a situation where only two players are involved in the play. This term is used across all poker variants.</p>
<h3>Understanding Heads-Up</h3>
<p>In poker, <b>heads-up</b> refers to a situation where only two players are involved in the play. This can occur in a tournament when all other players have been eliminated, leaving only two players to compete for the championship. It can also refer to a cash game that is played by just two players.</p>
<h3>Impact of Heads-Up on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Playing <b>heads-up</b> poker requires a different strategy than full-table play. Since there are only two players, hand values increase significantly. Players will often need to play more aggressively and bluff more frequently. It&#039;s also essential to study the other player closely and adapt your strategy to their playing style.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Heads-Up&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, in a tournament setting, if all but two players have been eliminated, those two players will play heads-up until a winner is determined. Similarly, in a cash game, if only two players are playing, they are said to be playing heads-up.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;John and Mary were left playing heads-up in the tournament after all other players were eliminated.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a weaker hand, Tom decided to bluff since he was playing heads-up and the chances of his opponent having a strong hand were lower.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Playing heads-up, Mary had to adjust her strategy to play more hands and be more aggressive.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.412'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Hero Call</h2>
<p>A hero call in poker refers to a situation where a player makes a call with a marginal or weak hand, based on a read of their opponent. This term is used across all poker variants.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Hero Call</h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>hero call</b> refers to when a player makes a call with a hand that&#039;s considered marginal or weak, typically against a strong bet or raise. This decision is often based on the player&#039;s read of their opponent&#039;s behavior, betting patterns, or perceived bluff. Hero calls are risky and require a strong understanding of opponent tendencies.</p>
<h3>Impact of a Hero Call on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Making a <b>hero call</b> can significantly influence a player&#039;s strategy in a poker game. It demonstrates a high level of confidence in one&#039;s ability to read opponents and can potentially yield a large pot. However, hero calls are high-risk moves and can lead to significant chip loss if the read is incorrect.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Hero Call&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em, if a player suspects their opponent is bluffing based on their betting pattern, they might decide to make a hero call with a marginal hand. The decision to make this <b>hero call</b> is based on the player&#039;s read of their opponent, rather than the strength of their own hand.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;John made a hero call with just a pair of twos, correctly suspecting his opponent was bluffing with a high-card hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite holding only a low pair, Mary decided to make a hero call based on her read of her opponent&#039;s erratic betting.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Tom made a hero call with his weak hand, but it turned out to be a mistake as his opponent was holding a straight.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.416'>&nbsp;</a><h2>High-Card</h2>
<p>A high card in poker refers to a hand where no other hand combination is possible, with the value of the hand determined by the highest card. This term is used across all poker variants.</p>
<h3>Understanding a High Card</h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>high card</b> hand is one where no other poker hand combination, such as a pair or a flush, is possible. In such cases, the value of the hand is determined by the highest card. For example, if two players have high card hands, the player with the highest card in their hand wins. If the highest cards are the same, then the second highest cards are compared, and so on.</p>
<h3>Impact of a High Card on Game Strategy</h3>
<p>Having a <b>high card</b> significantly influences a player&#039;s strategy in a poker game. It&#039;s the lowest-ranking hand in poker, so players with a high card hand often choose to fold, unless they believe they can bluff their way to winning the pot. However, if the community cards offer no help and the betting has been low, a player might decide to stay in the game in the hope that their high card is enough to win.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;High Card&quot;</h3>
<p>For example, in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em, if a player&#039;s hand and the community cards result in no pairs, flushes, or any other poker hand combination, the player is said to have a high card hand. The decision to bet, call, raise, or fold will depend on the player&#039;s read of the game situation and their opponents.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;John, with a high card hand of Ace, decided to bluff and raise the bet.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having just a high card, Mary decided to call the bet as the pot odds were in her favor.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Holding only a high card, Tom decided to fold, believing his chances of winning the pot were low.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.417'>&nbsp;</a><h2>High-Low</h2>
<p>Split pot games. </p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.418'>&nbsp;</a><h2>High-Low Split</h2>
<p>Games where half the pot goes to the highest ranking poker hand and half goes to the lowest ranking poker hand </p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.419'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Hijack</h2>
<p><b>Hijack</b> is a term used in poker to refer to the position to the right of the &#039;cut-off&#039; and two seats to the right of the &#039;button&#039;. This position is also known as the <b>&quot;HJ&quot;</b>.</p>
<h3>What is Hijack? </h3>
<p>The term <b>Hijack</b> in poker refers to a specific position on the poker table during a game. The Hijack is the player who acts before the player in the &#039;cut-off&#039; position, which is the seat to the immediate right of the dealer or &#039;button&#039;. The name &#039;Hijack&#039; suggests the idea of &#039;hijacking&#039; or taking advantage of the powerful positions like the cut-off and the button by acting aggressively.</p>
<h3>Why is the Hijack Position Important? </h3>
<p>The <b>Hijack</b> position is important because it&#039;s a relatively late position in a round of betting, meaning the player in the Hijack position gets to see most of the other players act before they do. This information can be used to their advantage, as they can adjust their strategy based on the actions of the players who acted before them. They can <b>play a wider range of hands</b> compared to the early positions and can frequently <b>steal the blinds</b>.</p>
<h3>Example of Hijack </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re in the <b>Hijack</b> position and everyone before you folds, you might decide to raise, regardless of your cards, in an attempt to steal the blinds. This is because there are fewer players left to act after you, reducing the chances that someone has a strong hand.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The player in the Hijack position decided to raise, trying to steal the blinds.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Being in the Hijack allowed him to play a wider range of hands.&quot;</li><li>&quot;From the Hijack position, he had a good view of the action before making his decision.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.424'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Hold'em</h2>
<p>Also known as Texas Hold 'em, where the players get two down cards and five community cards. See our complete Hold 'em rules in our Game Rules section.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.425'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Hole Cards</h2>
<p>Hole Cards are the private cards dealt face-down to each player in games of poker. These cards are only known to the player they are dealt to, and form part of each player&#039;s hand in combination with the community cards.</p>
<h3>What are Hole Cards? </h3>
<p>In poker, <b>Hole Cards</b> are the private cards each player is dealt at the beginning of a hand. They&#039;re called &#039;Hole Cards&#039; because they are kept hidden, or &#039;in the hole&#039;, from the other players. The number of Hole Cards dealt can vary depending on the variant of poker being played. In Texas Hold&#039;em, each player receives two Hole Cards, while in Omaha, players are dealt four.</p>
<h3>The Role of Hole Cards in Poker </h3>
<p>Hole Cards play a crucial role in determining a player&#039;s strategy in a hand. In games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha, the strength of your <b>Hole Cards</b> is a key factor in whether you should enter a pot or fold your hand. Strong Hole Cards give players confidence to bet and raise, while weak Hole Cards generally suggest a player should fold, unless they are attempting a <b>bluff</b>.</p>
<h3>How to Use Hole Cards </h3>
<p>Using <b>Hole Cards</b> effectively is a major part of poker strategy. Players must assess the strength of their Hole Cards in relation to the community cards on the board and their opponents&#039; potential hands. A common strategy is to play aggressively when you have strong Hole Cards, and to fold or bluff when your Hole Cards are weak.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Hole Cards&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing Texas Hold&#039;em and your Hole Cards are an Ace and a King of the same suit, this is considered a strong starting hand. You would likely choose to bet or raise in this situation.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Her Hole Cards were a pair of Aces, giving her a strong start.&quot;</li><li>&quot;With weak Hole Cards, he decided to fold and wait for a better hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Even with mediocre Hole Cards, she managed to bluff her way to victory.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.426'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Hollywood</h2>
<p>To &quot;Hollywood&quot; (used as a verb) refers to acting or talking in an exaggerated way so as to encourage a specific reaction from an opponent during a hand. &quot;Hollywooding&quot; often refers to actions intended to be deceptive, such as when a player talks a great deal and acts comfortable, thus appearing very strong when in fact the player’s hand is weak. </p>
<p>The term is also sometimes used as a criticism, referring to &quot;overacting&quot; or taking too much time to act when a decision doesn’t necessarily require it.</p>
