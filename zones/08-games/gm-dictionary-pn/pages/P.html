<a name='name.626'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Pair</h2>
<p>A &#039;Pair&#039; in poker refers to a hand that contains two cards of the same rank.</p>
<h3>What is a Pair in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Pair&#039; is a hand that contains two cards of the same rank. For example, if you have two 8s, you have a pair of 8s. Pairs are the second lowest hand in poker, ranking above high card and below two pair.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Pair </h3>
<p>A pair can be a strong hand, but it can also be beaten by any hand that contains two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, or a royal flush. The value of a pair is primarily determined by the rank of the pair, with a pair of Aces being the highest and a pair of twos being the lowest.</p>
<h3>Playing a Pair </h3>
<p>How a player should play a pair depends on a variety of factors, including their position, the action in front of them, the strength of their pair, and the texture of the board.</p>
<h3>Example of a &quot;Pair&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player is dealt an Ace and another Ace in Texas Hold&#039;em poker, they have a pair of Aces.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He was dealt a pair of Kings, a strong starting hand in Texas Hold&#039;em.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She made a pair of Queens on the flop, giving her the lead in the hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite only having a pair of twos, he decided to bet to try to bluff his opponent.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.628'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Passive</h2>
<p>&#039;Passive&#039; in poker refers to a playing style characterized by a reluctance to bet and raise, instead often opting to check and call.</p>
<h3>What is Passive in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, &#039;Passive&#039; refers to a playing style where a player often opts to check or call rather than bet or raise. Passive players tend to avoid confrontation and prefer to let their opponents dictate the action. While this style may limit potential losses, it also often misses opportunities for profit.</p>
<h3>Understanding Passive Play </h3>
<p>Passive play is characterized by a lack of aggression. Passive players often check or call, rather than betting or raising. They tend to play fewer hands, and when they do get involved, they usually let their opponents dictate the action.</p>
<h3>Playing Against Passive Players </h3>
<p>Playing against passive players can provide an opportunity to control the action and dictate the size of the pot. However, when a typically passive player suddenly starts betting or raising, it often indicates a very strong hand.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Passive&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, a player who consistently checks or calls, rather than betting or raising, can be considered a passive player.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Despite having a strong hand, he played it passively and just called the bets.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She noticed her opponent&#039;s passive play and took advantage by controlling the betting.&quot;</li><li>&quot;His passive play style allowed him to limit his losses, but also often missed opportunities for profit.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>&#039;Pocket Rockets&#039; in poker is a slang term that refers to being dealt two Aces as your starting hand in Texas Hold&#039;em.</p>
<h3>What are Pocket Rockets in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, &#039;Pocket Rockets&#039; is a slang term that refers to being dealt two Aces as your starting hand in Texas Hold&#039;em. This is the best possible starting hand in Texas Hold&#039;em, as Aces are the highest ranked card and a pair is the highest possible pair.</p>
<h3>Understanding Pocket Rockets </h3>
<p>While Pocket Rockets are the best possible starting hand, they are not unbeatable and should be played carefully. If the community cards (flop, turn, river) do not improve your hand and another player makes a strong hand (such as a straight or a flush), your Pocket Rockets could end up losing.</p>
<h3>Playing Pocket Rockets </h3>
<p>Typically, Pocket Rockets are played aggressively pre-flop to try and reduce the field of players and increase the chances that your Aces hold up by the river.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Pocket Rockets&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player is dealt two Aces in Texas Hold&#039;em poker, they have Pocket Rockets.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He looked down to see Pocket Rockets, the best starting hand in Texas Hold&#039;em.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She raised pre-flop with her Pocket Rockets, hoping to thin the field.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having Pocket Rockets, he lost the hand when his opponent made a flush.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.656'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Poker Face</h2>
<p>A &#039;Poker Face&#039; in poker refers to a blank, emotionless expression that hides a player&#039;s true thoughts and intentions. It&#039;s a crucial skill for poker players to prevent opponents from gaining information about their hand.</p>
<h3>What is a Poker Face in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Poker Face&#039; refers to a player&#039;s ability to mask their emotions and intentions. By maintaining a blank, emotionless expression, a player can prevent their opponents from gaining insights into the strength or weakness of their hand.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Poker Face </h3>
<p>Mastering the Poker Face is a valuable skill in poker. It&#039;s not just about keeping a straight face, it&#039;s about controlling your entire body language to avoid giving off &#039;tells&#039; - unconscious signals that can give away information about your hand.</p>
<h3>Perfecting Your Poker Face </h3>
<p>To perfect your Poker Face, it&#039;s important to practice controlling not just your facial expressions, but also your body language. This includes maintaining steady breathing, avoiding fidgeting, and keeping your reactions consistent, regardless of your hand strength.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Poker Face&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt a strong hand, keeping a Poker Face would involve controlling your excitement to prevent other players from realizing you have a strong hand.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Despite having a royal flush, he maintained his Poker Face, not giving any hint of the strength of his hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She worked hard to perfect her Poker Face, practicing in front of a mirror to control her expressions.&quot;</li><li>&quot;His lack of a Poker Face gave away the strength of his hand, allowing his opponent to fold before losing more money.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.660'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Polarized</h2>
<p>In poker, &quot;Polarized&quot; refers to a situation where a player&#039;s range is split into very strong hands and bluffs, with no medium-strength hands. It&#039;s a term used to describe a player&#039;s potential holdings in games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha.</p>
<h3>Understanding Polarized in Poker </h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, a <b>Polarized</b> range refers to a situation where a player&#039;s potential holdings are either very strong hands or bluffs, with no medium-strength hands. This term is used across all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, and applies to both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>When a player is said to be polarized, it means they are representing either a very strong hand or a bluff, and not much in between. This typically happens in situations where a player makes a large bet or raise, indicating they either have a very strong hand or are bluffing.</p>
<h3>Examples of Polarized in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the concept of a <b>Polarized</b> range in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em game, a player makes a large bet on a board of A-K-4-2-9. They are representing a polarized range, suggesting they have a strong hand like two pair or better, or they have a bluff.<br/>
In an Omaha tournament, a player makes a big raise on a board of 10-J-Q-K-2. Their range is polarized, indicating they either have a strong hand like a straight or flush, or a bluff.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He made a large bet on the river, polarizing his range to either a strong hand or a bluff.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Understanding when an opponent&#039;s range is polarized can help you make better decisions in tough spots.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Poker strategy often involves trying to polarize your range in certain situations to put maximum pressure on your opponents.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.661'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Position</h2>
<p>A &#039;Position&#039; in poker refers to a player&#039;s place in the betting order, which is determined by the dealer button. Position is a crucial factor in poker strategy as it influences the amount of information a player has before they need to act.</p>
<h3>What is Position in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, &#039;Position&#039; refers to where a player sits in relation to the dealer button, which determines the order in which players act during a hand. This is a critical aspect of poker strategy, as the amount of information a player has before they need to act can significantly influence their decisions.</p>
<h3>Understanding Position </h3>
<p>There are three general types of position: early, middle, and late. Early position is usually considered the weakest, as players must act first without knowing what others will do. Middle position offers some information, but not as much as late position. Late position, particularly the dealer position, is considered the strongest, as these players act last and have the most information about others&#039; actions.</p>
<h3>Using Position in Poker Strategy </h3>
<p>Understanding and using position effectively can provide a significant advantage in poker. In general, playing more hands from late position and fewer hands from early position can be a successful strategy, as it allows players to make more informed decisions.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Position&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player is seated directly to the left of the dealer button, they are said to be in &#039;early position&#039; and will be among the first to act.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He used his late position to his advantage, observing his opponents&#039; actions before making his move.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Being in early position, she decided to play conservatively, not knowing how her opponents would act.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Understanding the importance of position, he adjusted his strategy based on his place in the betting order.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>In poker, the &#039;Pot&#039; refers to the total amount of money that players have bet during a single round or hand. It is the prize that the players are competing for, with the winner of the hand winning the pot.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Pot </h3>
<p>The pot is formed by the accumulation of bets made by players during a hand. It starts to form with the blinds or antes, and grows with each round of betting. The size of the pot can often influence the decisions that players make, as they weigh the potential winnings against the amount they have to risk.</p>
<p>The pot can be won in two ways: either by having the best hand at showdown, or by causing all other players to fold their hands.</p>
<h3>Playing for the Pot </h3>
<p>The goal in poker is to win the pot. Players use their betting strategy to try to maximize the amount they win when they have the best hand, and minimize the amount they lose when they don&#039;t. Understanding the size of the pot is crucial for making decisions about how much to bet or whether to call a bet.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Pot&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and the first player bets $10, the second player calls, and the third player raises to $30, the total pot would now be $70.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He decided to call the bet, as the potential winnings from the large pot were worth the risk.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She calculated the size of the pot to determine how much to bet.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The pot had grown large, creating a tense showdown between the final two players.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.665'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Pot Committed</h2>
<p>A reference to (1) a player having already committed significant chips to a pot, thus making it difficult for that player to fold to a subsequent bet or raise; or (2) a player having bet a large percentage of his or her stack in a hand and thus being similarly less likely to fold to another bet or raise. In either case, the player having committed chips already signifies that player's likely &quot;commitment&quot; to staying in the hand.</p>

<a name='name.667'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Pot Odds</h2>
<p>The amount of money in the pot compared to the amount you must put in the pot to continue playing. For example, suppose there is $60 in the pot. Somebody bets $6, so the pot now contains $66. It costs you $6 to call, so your pot odds are 11:1. If your chance of having the best hand is at least one out of twelve, you should call. </p>
<p>Pot odds also apply to draws. For instance, suppose you have a draw to the nut flush with one card left to come. In this case, you are about a 4:1 underdog to make your flush. If it costs you $8 to call the bet, then there must be at least $32 in the pot (including the most recent bet) to make your call correct.</p>

<a name='name.681'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Push</h2>
<p>&#039;Push&#039; in poker usually refers to going &#039;all-in&#039;, meaning betting all of one&#039;s chips.</p>
<h3>What is a Push in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, &#039;Push&#039; is a term often used to describe a player going &#039;all-in&#039;, which means betting all of their remaining chips. This move is typically used in high-pressure situations where a player either has a very strong hand or needs to bluff to try to win the pot.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Push </h3>
<p>A push is a high-risk, high-reward move. It can result in a player either doubling their stack or being eliminated from the game. The decision to push should be based on a player&#039;s hand strength, their position at the table, the size of their chip stack, and their read on the other players.</p>
<h3>When to Push </h3>
<p>Deciding when to push all-in requires careful consideration. Some common scenarios where a player might decide to push include when they have a very strong hand, when they&#039;re short-stacked and need to double up to stay in the game, or when they believe they can make their opponents fold.</p>
<h3>Example of a &quot;Push&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player has a pair of Aces in Texas Hold&#039;em poker, they might decide to push all-in pre-flop to try to win the pot outright or to get called by a weaker hand.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Seeing his pocket Aces, he decided to push all-in pre-flop.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She pushed all-in on the river, putting pressure on her opponents to make a decision.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite being short-stacked, his decision to push all-in paid off when he doubled up.&quot;</li></ul>
