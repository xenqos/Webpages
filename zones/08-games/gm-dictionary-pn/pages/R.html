<a name='name.700'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Raise</h2>
<p>A &#039;Raise&#039; in poker refers to increasing the current amount of the bet in a betting round.</p>
<h3>What is a Raise in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Raise&#039; is a move where a player increases the current amount of the bet in a betting round. By raising, a player requires any other player who wants to remain in the hand to at least match their raise, adding more money to the pot.</p>
<h3>Understanding Raises </h3>
<p>Raising can be a powerful move in poker, used to accomplish various goals. A player may raise to try to force other players to fold, to gain more information about other players&#039; hands, or to increase the size of the pot when they have a strong hand.</p>
<h3>Making a Raise </h3>
<p>When making a raise, a player must at least double the amount of the previous bet or raise. For example, if the previous bet was $5, a player must raise to at least $10.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Raise&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player bets $5 and another player raises to $15, the second player has made a raise.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He decided to raise pre-flop with his pair of aces.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She made a raise on the river to put pressure on her opponents.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a weak hand, he decided to raise as a bluff.&quot;</li></ul>

<h3>Rake Explained - How Do Casinos Make Money on Poker?</h3>
<p>Casinos make money from poker by taking what&#039;s called a rake. The rake in a poker cash game is when the house takes a percentage of the pot. In poker tournaments, a specified portion of the buy-in will go to the house while the rest goes into the prize pool. </p>
<h4>Rake Definition - What is Rake in Poker? </h4>
<p>Rake in poker is the house&#039;s compensation for hosting a poker game. However, not all cardrooms take a rake. In some poker clubs, members are required to pay a membership fee to join the club and then require payment for time spent at the table. </p>
<p>Generally, the rake is explained as the money taken by the casino/cardroom/poker club. </p>
<h4>How is Rake Calculated in Poker?</h4>
<p>How the rake is calculated varies from game to game and casino to casino. Usually, a poker room will have a set percentage of the pot from each hand go to the house. Generally, anywhere from 5% to 10% of the pot in each poker will be taken for the rake. </p>
<p>The rake will also often be capped. The cap is the maximum amount of rake a poker room can take from a hand. </p>
<p>If you ask a dealer or the floor what the rake is, they will often reply, &quot;the rake is X% capped at $X.&quot; </p>
<h4>How is Rake Taken in Poker?</h4>
<p>The table dealer calculates the rake in live poker games and takes the house fee from the pot. The dealer will work out the pot size and rake accordingly to the percentage set by the poker room.  </p>
<p>The rake is automatically taken through the poker software in online poker games. </p>
<h4>How is Rake Taken in Poker Tournaments?</h4>
<p>In poker tournaments, the rake is paid through your buy-in, often called an entry fee. There may be another percentage from the buy-in taken for the tournament dealers and staff. </p>
<p>For example, in the $10,000 WSOP Main Event, not all of the buy-in goes to the prize pool. For the 2023 WSOP Main Event, 4.9% of the buy-in is withheld for entry fees, and a further 2.1% is taken for the dealers and staff. </p>
<h4>How is Rake Taken in Poker Cash Games?</h4>
<p>As mentioned, the dealer takes the rake from each pot, but did you know that not every pot has a rake taken? </p>
<p>If a player wins the pot preflop, the house will not take a rake in some poker rooms. For example, a player could raise $10, and a second player could three-bet to $60. A third player could then move all in for $300. If the remaining players folded, the all-in player would make $70 without paying any rake. </p>
<p>However, if a player raises to $10 and gets one caller, and the initial raiser wins the pot on the flop, the house will take a rake as a flop has been dealt. </p>
<p>The above is a general and most common example, but this can vary from poker room to poker room. </p>
<h3>How Do Casinos Make Money From Poker?</h3>
<p>Casinos, cardrooms and poker rooms make money from poker by taking a rake, entry fee or timed fee from the players. </p>
<p>In poker cash games, the casino often takes a rake from every poker hand in the room. If a poker room hosts 30 cash games, the casino can profit substantially from this. The usual poker hand lasts 1-2 minutes. If that&#039;s 30 hands an hour being raked across 30 tables, the house can make a lot of money. </p>
<p>As mentioned with poker tournaments, the rake is included in the buy-in. If a poker tournament has a $100 buy-in, shown as $85+$15, the $85 is allocated for the prize money, while the remaining $15 will be taken as entry fees and staff payments.  </p>
<h3>Online Poker Rake vs Live Poker Rake - What’s the Difference? </h3>
<p>The rake in live games is generally higher than for online poker. Some cardrooms will not take a percentage rake in any community card poker game like Texas Hold&#039;em when a hand does not have a flop. This is called &quot;no flop, no drop&quot;.</p>
<h4>How to Pay Rake in Live Poker</h4>
<p>You don&#039;t have to do anything to pay for the rake in live poker, as the table dealer will take the rake from the pot. In raked games, you only pay rake in hands that you play in for live poker. </p>
<p>In timed games, the rake you pay is a set fee. For example, for every 30 minutes, you&#039;re required to pay $10. If you play for five hours, you must pay the casino $100. </p>
<h3>Can You Beat the Rake in Poker?</h3>
<p>In regulated poker games, it is possible to beat the rake. If it weren&#039;t possible, there wouldn&#039;t be the thousands of professional poker players that exist today. However, in some &quot;underground&quot; poker games, the rake may be a lot higher, which may not be beatable. </p>
<p>You can beat the rake, but unfortunately, it is not something you can avoid. You want to find the games with the lowest rake and cap to have the highest win rate possible. </p>
<h4>How to Beat the Rake in Poker</h4>
<h5>Avoid Small Pots</h5>
<p>The rake diminishes, as a percentage of the pot, as the pot grows beyond the size necessary for the maximum rake. For example, in a room with a 10%, $6 maximum rake taken in dollar increments, any pot of $10 on up to $60 will be raked the full 10%. However, a pot over $60 will be raked at less than 10%. And the larger the pot is beyond that, the lower the percentage of the pot will be raked.</p>
<h5>Avoid Short-Stacked Games</h5>
<p>In an unraked game, it may be advantageous for you to sit in a game with opponents who are short-stacked, depending on how they play and whether you can exploit that play. For example, suppose the short stacks are extremely passive and timid. In that case, you can often have an excellent session by being aggressive in the right spots, regardless of your hand, and getting them to release their hands, giving you small but consistent wins.</p>
<p>But this strategy is rarely effective in a heavily raked game since the huge drain of the large rake on those small pots will often diminish to zero any profit you can make. Even if you are effective with your strategy, it will be offset by a large rake.</p>
<h5>Steal the Blinds</h5>
<p>Most rooms have the &quot;no flop, no drop&quot; rule, meaning that if there is no flop, there is no rake no matter how large the pot size. Check to make sure. If this is the case, then a strategy of trying to steal the blinds may make sense those hands produce the only small pots that aren&#039;t raked, meaning all of the profit goes to you, not to the house.</p>
<h4>How to Find the Lowest-Raked Poker Games</h4>
<p>There are several ways to find the lowest-raked poker games, and some of those are: </p>
<ul><li><b>Ask the floor</b> - If you&#039;re on the Vegas strip, for example, you can visit each poker room and speak to the staff to find out the rake. Once you&#039;ve found the poker room with a rake structure you&#039;re happy to pay, hop right in. </li><li><b>Compare online sites</b> - You can visit online sites like <b>PokerStars</b>, <b>888poker</b>, <b>PartyPoker</b> and <b>WPT Global</b> to see their rake structures. You&#039;ll be able to see how much rake is taken per stake and decide from there. </li><li><b>Look for rakeback programs online</b> - Rakeback programs are where you are awarded some of your rake back. A portion of the rake you have paid will be refunded to you. Visit the sites listed above to find the rakeback program perfect for you. </li><li><b>Pay attention to jackpots and high-hand promos</b> - In live poker games, more money from the pot may be taken from the pot that isn&#039;t considered part of the rake. Card rooms run jackpot and high-hand promotions, which could see an extra dollar or two taken from the pot in addition to the rake. Even though it doesn&#039;t sound like much, after a long session, you&#039;ll be surprised by how much this all adds up. </li></ul>
<h3>Best Poker Sites with the Lowest Rake</h3>
<p>As you would expect from the world’s biggest online poker site, <b>PokerStars</b> is often a trendsetter when it comes to new and innovative features. It also has one of the lowest rake structures of all the online poker rooms. </p>
<p>Here is information about PokerStars Rake-back poker bonuses and rewards, as well as information on rake-back bonuses from other major online operators.</p>
<h3>Rake-back Poker Bonuses and Rewards</h3><p> </p>
<p>Rakeback bonuses and rewards in poker are incentives offered by online poker sites to their players to encourage them to play regularly on their platform, accumulating points that can then be redeemed for rakeback or other prizes.</p>
<h4>What are Rake-back Bonuses and Rewards in Poker?</h4>
<p>Rakeback bonuses and rewards can come in different forms, such as cashback, bonuses, freerolls, and other incentives. Some sites offer a flat percentage of rakeback, while others have a tiered system where players can earn more rakeback as they play more on the site.</p>
<h4>How do Rake-back Bonuses and Rewards Work in Poker?</h4>
<p>Rakeback bonuses and rewards can be a great way for poker players to increase their overall winnings and make their bankroll go further. However, it&#039;s important to note that not all poker sites offer rakeback, and some may have different terms and conditions for their rewards programs. It&#039;s important to research and compare different sites to find the best rakeback deals and rewards programs for your individual needs.</p>
<h5>Poker Rake-back Example</h5>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing online poker and the site you&#039;re playing on has a rake of 5%. If you play a hand where the pot reaches $100, the site would take $5 as rake.</p>
<p>If the site offers a 25% rakeback bonus, you would receive $1.25 back as a bonus. This would be credited to your account separately from your winnings.</p>
<p>So, in this example, your net cost for playing the hand would be $3.75, instead of $5. Over time, this can add up and help increase your overall winnings.</p>
<p>It&#039;s important to note that the exact amount of rakeback you receive can vary depending on the site&#039;s specific terms and conditions. Additionally, some sites may have a cap on the amount of rakeback you can receive in a certain period of time.</p>

<a name='name.703'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Range</h2>
<p>A &#039;Range&#039; in poker refers to the set of all hands a player can possibly have in a specific situation.</p>
<h3>What is a Range in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Range&#039; refers to the set of all hands a player could potentially have in a specific situation. This concept is crucial for strategic decision-making in poker, as it involves estimating the range of hands an opponent might have and adjusting your play accordingly.</p>
<h3>Understanding Ranges </h3>
<p>The concept of range is fundamental to poker strategy. It involves not just considering an opponent&#039;s current hand, but all possible hands they could have based on their actions. Players often use their understanding of ranges to make educated guesses about an opponent&#039;s hand and to inform their betting strategy.</p>
<h3>Using Range in Poker Strategy </h3>
<p>Understanding and using ranges effectively can provide a significant edge in poker. By estimating the range of hands an opponent could have, players can make more informed decisions about when to fold, call, or raise.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Range&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player always raises with high pairs and high suited connectors, then that is their range in that situation.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He put his opponent on a range of high pairs, influencing his decision to fold.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She narrowed down her opponent&#039;s range based on their aggressive betting and decided to call.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Understanding the importance of range, he adjusted his strategy based on his estimate of his opponent&#039;s possible hands.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>A &#039;Read&#039; in poker refers to the ability to understand and interpret an opponent&#039;s actions, behaviors, or mannerisms at the poker table, which can provide clues about the strength or weakness of their hand.</p>
<h3>What is a Read in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Read&#039; refers to the ability to interpret an opponent&#039;s actions, behaviors, or mannerisms during a game, which can provide clues about the strength or weakness of their hand. This is a crucial skill in poker, as it can help inform a player&#039;s decisions about whether to fold, call, or raise.</p>
<h3>Understanding Reads </h3>
<p>Understanding reads requires a good deal of observation, experience, and intuition. It&#039;s important to not just focus on the cards, but also to pay attention to your opponents&#039; behavior. Reads can come from physical tells, betting patterns, player conversation, or even previous hands.</p>
<h3>Using Reads </h3>
<p>Using reads effectively can give players a significant edge in poker. However, it&#039;s important to remember that experienced players may use false tells to mislead their opponents, so reads should be used as part of a larger overall strategy, not as the sole basis for decision-making.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Read&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if an opponent always scratches their nose when they have a weak hand, this can be a read that can help inform your betting decisions.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He made a successful read on his opponent&#039;s bluff, allowing him to win the pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She has a reputation for being able to make accurate reads, making her a formidable opponent at the poker table.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite his read, he decided to fold, not wanting to risk too many chips on one hand.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>The &#039;River&#039; in poker refers to the last community card dealt in certain poker games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha. It&#039;s the final opportunity for players to improve their hands or bluff their opponents.</p>
<h3>What is a River in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, the &#039;River&#039; refers to the fifth and final community card dealt in certain poker games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha. The River is the last card to be dealt, offering players their final opportunity to improve their hand or bluff their opponents.</p>
<h3>Understanding the River </h3>
<p>The River is a critical stage in poker as it&#039;s the last chance for players to decide their betting strategy based on the strength of their final hand. After the River card is dealt, the final round of betting takes place, followed by the showdown where players reveal their hands.</p>
<h3>Playing the River </h3>
<p>When the River card is dealt, players need to evaluate their hand strength and the potential hands of their opponents. This is also a crucial time for bluffing or making big bets if you have a strong hand.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;River&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and the community cards are A-K-Q-J-10, the 10 would be the River card.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Despite having a weak hand, the River card gave him a flush, winning him the pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She decided to make a large bet after the River card was dealt, successfully bluffing her opponents.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The River card failed to improve his hand, but he decided to bluff and made a large bet.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.724'>&nbsp;</a><h2>ROI</h2>
<p>Short for “return on investment,” in poker the term is most often used with reference to tournaments as a way to measure and compare players’ profitability.</p>
<p>ROI is calculated as a percentage by dividing one’s profit (the amount one cashes for minus the buy-in) by one’s expense (the buy-in) and multiplying the result by 100. Say a player enters a $100 tournament and cashes for $150. Divide the profit ($50) by the buy-in ($100) to get 0.5, then multiply that by 100 for an ROI of 50%.</p>

<a name='name.730'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Royal Flush</h2>
<p>A &#039;Royal Flush&#039; in poker is the highest possible hand. It consists of the Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10, all of the same suit.</p>
<h3>What is a Royal Flush in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Royal Flush&#039; is the best possible hand a player can have. It consists of the Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10, all of the same suit. This hand is unbeatable and is the rarest hand to get in poker games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Royal Flush </h3>
<p>The chances of being dealt a Royal Flush are extremely low, with odds of 649,739 to 1 in a five-card game. Despite these odds, the excitement and potential winnings from hitting a Royal Flush, especially in high-stakes or tournament play, can be extremely significant.</p>
<h3>Playing a Royal Flush </h3>
<p>When a player hits a Royal Flush, the strategy is typically to try and maximize the pot. This can involve slow-playing (betting less than the strength of the hand would indicate in order to encourage others to bet more) or aggressive betting to try and build the pot.</p>
<h3>Example of a &quot;Royal Flush&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player is dealt the Ace and King of hearts in Texas Hold&#039;em, and the Queen, Jack, and 10 of hearts come on the board, they have a Royal Flush.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He hit a Royal Flush, the best possible hand in poker.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She couldn&#039;t believe her luck when she hit a Royal Flush in the high-stakes game.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite the odds, he managed to hit a Royal Flush and win the tournament.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.736'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Running It Twice</h2>
<p>In some cash games, if a player is all in before the river has been dealt, the players involved can agree to &quot;run it twice&quot; which means dealing the remaining streets two times, with half the pot in each instance going to the player making the best hand. (Players can also &quot;run it&quot; more than twice by having the remaining cards dealt more times, if they wish and the game allows it.)</p>
<p>For example, a player with

<q class='c'>A</q>
<q class='d'>K</q>

goes all in and gets called by another with

<q class='d'>Q</q>
<q class='c'>Q</q>


and they agree to run it twice. The first board is dealt and comes

<q class='d'>2</q>
<q class='s'>8</q>
<q class='h'>K</q>
<q class='c'>9</q>
<q class='s'>8</q>

meaning the first player wins with kings, then the second comes

<q class='h'>9</q>
<q class='d'>3</q>
<q class='c'>3</q>
<q class='h'>J</q>
<q class='d'>7</q>

meaning the second player wins with queens. The two players split the pot, each winning half.</p>
