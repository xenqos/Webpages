<a name='name.741'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Satellite</h2>
<p>A &#039;Satellite&#039; in poker is a type of tournament where the prize is an entry into a larger, more expensive tournament. It&#039;s a way for players to gain entry into high-stakes tournaments without having to pay the full entry fee.</p>
<h3>What is a Satellite in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Satellite&#039; is a tournament where the prize is not cash, but an entry into a larger, more expensive poker tournament. This allows players to participate in high-stakes tournaments without having to pay the full entry fee.</p>
<h3>Understanding Satellites </h3>
<p>Satellites are a popular way for players to gain entry into major poker tournaments. They are often much cheaper to enter than the target tournament, and players can win a seat in the target tournament by finishing in the top positions.</p>
<h3>Playing in Satellites </h3>
<p>Playing in satellites requires a different strategy than regular tournaments. Since the goal is to win a seat in a larger tournament rather than cash, the play can be more conservative with players aiming to survive rather than accumulate chips.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Satellite&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, a $100 satellite tournament might award a seat into a $1,000 tournament to the top finishers.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He entered a satellite and won a seat in the World Series of Poker Main Event.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She regularly plays in satellites to gain entry into high-stakes tournaments without having to pay the full buy-in.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The poker site offers daily satellites for their weekly high roller tournament.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.742'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Scare Card</h2>
<p>In poker, a &quot;Scare Card&quot; refers to a card that, when revealed, has the potential to significantly change the strength of hands. It&#039;s a term used to describe certain community cards in games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha.</p>
<h3>Understanding Scare Card in Poker </h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, a <b>Scare Card</b> refers to a card that, when it comes on the board, has the potential to significantly change the strength of hands. This term is used across all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, and applies to both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>A scare card can either complete potential draws, like flushes or straights, or put higher cards on the board that could make previously strong hands, like top pair, less powerful. Players often use the appearance of a scare card as an opportunity to bluff.</p>
<h3>Examples of Scare Card in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the concept of a <b>Scare Card</b> in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em game, you&#039;re holding A-K, and the flop comes A-7-2. The turn card is a Queen. This Queen is a scare card, as it could give someone a pair of Queens or complete a straight.</p>
<p>In an Omaha tournament, you&#039;re dealt A-K-10-J and the flop comes 6-6-2. The turn card is a 6. This 6 is a scare card as it puts a potential four-of-a-kind or full house on the board.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Despite the scare card on the river, he decided to make a large bet, hoping his opponent would fold.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The turn brought a scare card, completing potential flush and straight draws.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Understanding how to react to scare cards is an important part of poker strategy.&quot;</li></ul>

<h3>What is a Set in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Set&#039; refers to a hand where a player has three of a kind, specifically when the player holds a pair in their hand and the third matching card is on the board. It&#039;s a strong hand that can often lead to winning the pot.</p>
<h3>Understanding Sets </h3>
<p>A Set is a powerful hand in poker, but it&#039;s not always easy to achieve because it requires very specific cards. It&#039;s different from &#039;trips&#039; where a player has one card in their hand and the other two matching cards are on the board.</p>
<h3>Playing Sets </h3>
<p>When playing a Set, it&#039;s often a good strategy to bet aggressively to extract value from opponents. However, it&#039;s also important to consider the potential for opponents to have stronger hands, such as straights or flushes.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Set&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player has two 7s in their hand and there&#039;s another 7 on the board, they have a Set.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He hit a Set on the flop, giving him a strong chance to win the hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She was disappointed when her Set was beaten by a flush.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a Set, he decided to fold due to the potential for a straight on the board.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.762'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Shoot-out</h2>
<p>A tournament with no rebuys. When you lose all your chips, you're out. More usually called a &quot;freeze-out&quot; or, in the case of a single table, a &quot;sit-and-go&quot;.</p>
<div><b>Usage:</b> <p>Also &quot;Shootout&quot;. Like in sentence &quot;He won the No Limit Holdem <i>Shoot-out</i> at the California State Poker Championship&quot;;</p></div>

<a name='name.763'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Shootout</h2>
<p>A multi-table tournament in which players separately play down to a single winner on each table, then the winners advance to the next round so on.  For example, a “shootout” event at the World Series of Poker might begin with 1,000 players playing at 100 ten-handed tables, with the 100 winners of each advancing to play at ten more ten-handed tables in the second round.  The ten winners of those tables would then play a final ten-handed table to determine a winner.</p>
<p>“Shootout” tournaments are popular among single table sit-n-go players, since the format is essentially to play a sequence of single table sit-n-gos.</p>

<p>A number of chips that is not very many compared to the other players at the table. If you have $10 in front of you, and everybody else at the table has over $100, you are playing on a short stack.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.766'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Short-Handed</h2>
<p>An adjective used to describe a game with few players.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.767'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Shot Clock</h2>
<p>With a shot clock at the table, players have a certain time to act on their hand. Typically players get 30 seconds per decision. On top of that, in most poker tournaments operating a shot clock, players get a certain amount of time bank cards. These cards are typically worth an additional 30 or 60 seconds.</p>
<p>The shot clock is a physical clock on the table that counts down the time players have left to act on their hand. Once the clock reaches zero without the player having decided to call, fold, bet, or raise, a player's hand is either dead, or a player is forced to play one of their time bank cards to gain some more time to think.</p>
<p>Every tournament organizer decided how many time bank cards players get at the beginning of the tournament. If a player has time bank cards left when he or she busts, those are typically forfeited. Some tournaments let you carry over your time bank cards to coming days, and some give out additional cards upon making the next day, and/or making the final table.</p>
<div><b>Usage:</b> <p>The shot clock told us Phil Ivey only had 3 seconds left to act when he moved all in!</p></div>

<a name='name.771'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Showdown</h2>
<p>A &#039;Showdown&#039; in poker is the point at which all betting has ended and players remaining in the hand reveal their cards to determine who has the best hand and is the winner of the pot.</p>
<h3>What is a Showdown in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Showdown&#039; is the stage of the game where all betting has concluded, and the remaining players reveal their cards to determine the winner. The player with the best hand according to the poker hand rankings wins the pot.</p>
<h3>Understanding Showdown </h3>
<p>The Showdown occurs only if there are two or more players left after the final betting round. Players reveal their cards, and the player with the best hand wins. If two or more players have identical hands, the pot is split equally between them.</p>
<h3>The Order of Showdown </h3>
<p>In a Showdown, the last player to have made a bet or raise is the first one to show their hand. If no betting occurred on the final round, the player to the left of the dealer button is the first to show. The Showdown continues clockwise around the table.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Showdown&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em, after the final round of betting on the river, all remaining players go to a Showdown.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He was confident going into the Showdown with his full house.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She decided to call his bet and take the hand to Showdown.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The Showdown revealed that he had been bluffing with a high card.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.772'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Showdown Value</h2>
<p>Showdown Value&#039; in poker refers to the strength of a poker hand likely to win at showdown if no further betting occurs. It&#039;s a term used to analyze the potential of a hand to win without any additional bets or bluffs.</p>
<h3>What is Showdown Value in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, &#039;Showdown Value&#039; refers to the potential of a hand to win at the end of a round (the showdown) if no further betting occurs. It&#039;s a concept used to evaluate whether a hand is strong enough to be worth taking to showdown without needing to bluff.</p>
<h3>Understanding Showdown Value </h3>
<p>Understanding showdown value is important for making decisions about whether to bet, call, or fold. If a hand has strong showdown value, a player may decide to check or call rather than bet or raise, with the aim of getting to the showdown without inflating the pot.</p>
<p>Hands with good showdown value are often medium-strength hands that are not strong enough to bet for value but too strong to turn into a bluff. These might include hands like middle pair or low top pair.</p>
<h3>Using Showdown Value in Your Strategy </h3>
<p>Showdown value is a key concept in deciding whether to play passively (by checking or calling) or aggressively (by betting or raising).</p>
<p>If you believe your hand has good showdown value, you might choose to play more passively to get to showdown without risking more chips. However, if you think your hand has low showdown value, you might opt for a more aggressive strategy to try to make your opponents fold.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Showdown Value&quot; </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt a hand like middle pair. While it&#039;s not a particularly strong hand, it might have decent showdown value, particularly if the board is low and uncoordinated and your opponents are playing passively.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;With middle pair on a low, uncoordinated board, he believed his hand had good showdown value and decided to check.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She assessed her top pair, weak kicker as having enough showdown value to call her opponent&#039;s bet, but not strong enough to raise.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite not having a strong hand, he believed his hand had enough showdown value to see the river.&quot;</li></ul>
<h3>Showdown Value in Poker FAQs </h3>
<p>[FAQ]<br/>
Q: What is showdown value in poker?<br/>
A: Showdown value in poker refers to the potential of a hand to win at the end of a round (the showdown) if no further betting occurs.</p>
<p>Q: How does showdown value impact my strategy?<br/>
A: Understanding showdown value can help you decide whether to bet, call, or fold. If a hand has strong showdown value, you might decide to play more passively to get to showdown without risking more chips.</p>
<p>Q: Can any hand have showdown value?<br/>
A: Technically, any hand can have showdown value if it has the potential to win at showdown. However, in practice, the term is often used to describe medium-strength hands that are not strong enough to bet for value but too strong to turn into a bluff.</p>
<p>Q: Can showdown value change during a hand?<br/>
A: Yes, a hand&#039;s showdown value can change as community cards are dealt and the strength of your hand relative to the possible hands of your opponents changes.</p>

<a name='name.775'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Side Pot</h2>
<p>Created once a player is all in and other players continue betting &quot;on the side&quot; (literally). The side pot is distinct from the main pot in that only the players still betting play for it, while the all-in player can only win the main pot. If there are multiple all-in players, multiple side pots can potentially be created.</p>
<p>For example, in a $1/$2 no-limit hold'em game, Player A raises to $8 from early position, then Player B reraises all in with his last $20 from the cutoff seat. Player C then calls the reraise from the button, the blinds fold, and Player A calls as well.  The main pot having been created, Players A and C will then bet into a side pot after the flop if they wish.</p>

<a name='name.800'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Stack</h2>
<p>A &#039;Stack&#039; in poker refers to the total amount of chips a player has in a poker game.</p>
<h3>What is a Stack in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Stack&#039; refers to the total amount of chips a player has at any given time during a poker game. It is a crucial aspect of the game as a player&#039;s stack size can significantly influence their strategy and the way they play their hands.</p>
<h3>Understanding Stacks </h3>
<p>The size of a player&#039;s stack can vary greatly, from a short stack (few chips) to a deep stack (many chips). The size of a player&#039;s stack in relation to the blinds and/or antes is known as their &#039;stack-to-pot ratio&#039; or SPR, and it can greatly influence their betting decisions.</p>
<h3>Playing Different Stack Sizes </h3>
<p>Different stack sizes can require different strategies. Short stacks may need to play more aggressively to avoid being blinded out, while deep stacks can afford to play more conservatively and wait for strong hands.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Stack&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player has 5,000 chips in a tournament, that is their stack.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He doubled his stack after winning a big hand with a full house.&quot;</li><li>&quot;With a short stack, she decided to go all-in in an attempt to double up.&quot;</li><li>&quot;His stack was one of the largest at the table, allowing him to play more conservatively.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.801'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Stack-to-pot Ratio</h2>
<p>The &#039;Stack-to-pot Ratio&#039; (SPR) in poker is a mathematical concept used to guide betting decisions during a hand. It is calculated by dividing the size of the stack (the amount of money a player has left to bet) by the size of the pot.</p>
<h3>What is Stack-to-pot Ratio in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, the &#039;Stack-to-pot Ratio&#039; (SPR) is a calculation used to help make decisions about how to play a hand. The SPR is determined by dividing the size of your stack (the amount of money you have left to bet) by the size of the pot.</p>
<h3>What is Stack-to-pot Ratio? </h3>
<p>The SPR is a concept that can help you determine the right strategy for a hand based on the relationship between the size of the pot and the size of your stack. A low SPR (where the pot is large compared to your stack) often means that you are committed to the pot and should play aggressively, while a high SPR (where the pot is small compared to your stack) might mean that you have more flexibility and can play more cautiously.</p>
<h3>Using Stack-to-pot Ratio in Your Strategy </h3>
<p>Knowing the SPR can be useful for planning your strategy for a hand. For example, if you have a strong hand and the SPR is low, you might want to play aggressively, as you are likely committed to the pot. Conversely, if the SPR is high and you have a marginal hand, you might want to play more conservatively.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Stack-to-pot Ratio&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and the pot is $100, and you have $300 left in your stack, the SPR would be 3. This means you have three times the current pot left in your stack.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;With a low stack-to-pot ratio, he decided to go all-in with his top pair.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Given the high stack-to-pot ratio, she played cautiously with her middle pair.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Knowing the stack-to-pot ratio helped him decide whether to play aggressively or conservatively.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.806'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Steal</h2>
<p>A &#039;Steal&#039; in poker refers to a type of bluff, where a player makes a bet or raise with a weak hand in an attempt to win the pot uncontested.</p>
<h3>What is a Steal in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Steal&#039; is a type of bluff where a player makes a bet or raise with a weak hand, hoping to force their opponents to fold and win the pot uncontested. It&#039;s a common strategy, particularly in no-limit hold&#039;em, often executed by players in late position.</p>
<h3>Understanding Steals </h3>
<p>Steals are typically attempted when a player is in a late position and it&#039;s been folded around to them. The goal is to win the blinds and antes without seeing a flop. While this is a high-risk strategy, it can be highly rewarding if executed correctly.</p>
<h3>Attempting a Steal </h3>
<p>When attempting a steal, it&#039;s crucial to be aware of the playing styles of your opponents. Players who frequently call or raise are less likely to fold to a steal. Understanding table dynamics and being able to read your opponents can greatly increase the chances of a successful steal.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Steal&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player in late position raises pre-flop with a weak hand, hoping to make the players in the blinds fold, that would be considered a steal.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He attempted a steal from the button, but the big blind called with a strong hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She was successful in her steal attempt, forcing the other players to fold pre-flop.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a weak hand, he decided to try for a steal due to his advantageous position.&quot;</li></ul>

<h3>What is a Straddle in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Straddle&#039; is an optional and voluntary bet made by a player after the blinds but before the cards are dealt. A straddle is usually twice the amount of the big blind and effectively acts as a third blind, increasing the stakes of the game.</p>
<h3>Understanding Straddles </h3>
<p>Straddles can add an extra layer of strategy to the game as they change the dynamic of the hand. The player who posts the straddle has the last action in the first betting round, which can be a significant advantage.</p>
<h3>Implementing a Straddle </h3>
<p>Deciding whether to straddle can depend on various factors, such as your position at the table, your chip stack, and your confidence in your post-flop play. It&#039;s a move often used by aggressive players to increase the pot size.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Straddle&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, in a $2/$4 game, a player could choose to straddle for $8 before the cards are dealt.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He decided to put a straddle on the pot to increase the stakes.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She used a straddle to put pressure on the other players.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite being short-stacked, he decided to straddle to try to build a bigger pot.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.816'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Straight</h2>
<p>A &#039;Straight&#039; in poker refers to a sequence of five consecutive cards of any suit.</p>
<h3>What is a Straight in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Straight&#039; is a hand that consists of five consecutive cards of any suit. For example, a hand that includes 5-6-7-8-9 of various suits is a straight. It is stronger than three of a kind and two pair but weaker than a flush.</p>
<h3>Understanding Straights </h3>
<p>A straight can be a powerful hand in poker. However, its strength can also depend on what the highest card of the straight is. An &quot;Ace-high&quot; straight (10-J-Q-K-A), also known as a &quot;Broadway&quot; straight, is the highest possible straight, while an &quot;Ace-low&quot; straight (A-2-3-4-5), also known as a &quot;wheel&quot; or &quot;bicycle&quot;, is the lowest possible straight.</p>
<h3>Playing a Straight </h3>
<p>When you have a straight, it can be a good opportunity to bet aggressively. However, you should also be aware of the community cards. If the board is showing a potential flush or higher straight, you may need to play more cautiously.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Straight&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player holds 6-7 and the board shows 8-9-10 of various suits, the player has a straight.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He won the hand with a 10-high straight, beating his opponent&#039;s three of a kind.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a straight, she lost the hand to a flush.&quot;</li><li>&quot;With four consecutive cards already in his hand, he was hoping to draw a card to complete his straight.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.821'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Street</h2>
<p>&#039;Street&#039; in poker refers to the various stages of dealing cards in a hand of poker.</p>
<h3>What is a Street in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Street&#039; is a term used to describe the various stages of dealing cards in a hand of poker. In Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha poker, there are four &#039;streets&#039;: the pre-flop, the flop, the turn, and the river.</p>
<h3>Understanding Streets </h3>
<p>Each street represents a different phase in the game, and the betting patterns and player behavior can change significantly from one street to the next. Understanding how to adjust your strategy based on the street is a key part of successful poker play.</p>
<h3>Playing Different Streets </h3>
<p>The pre-flop is the first street and occurs after the players receive their hole cards but before the community cards are dealt. The flop is the second street and happens after the first three community cards are dealt. The turn is the third street and comes after the fourth community card is dealt. The river is the final street and takes place after the last community card is dealt.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Street&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, a player might choose to play conservatively during the pre-flop and flop but then decide to play more aggressively during the turn and river.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He decided to raise on the final street after hitting a flush on the river.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She played aggressively on the early streets, but slowed down her betting on the river.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite missing his draw on the turn, he decided to bluff on the river, the final street.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.829'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Suck Out</h2>
<p>A slang term referring to a player drawing out an opponent to win a hand after having been an underdog to do so. For example, a player goes all in with

<q class='s'>K</q>
<q class='d'>K</q>

and is called by an opponent holding

<q class='c'>A</q>
<q class='h'>A</q>

A king then comes among the community cards, thus enabling the player to “suck out” and win the hand despite having been behind when the chips went in.</p>
