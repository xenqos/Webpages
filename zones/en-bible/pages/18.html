<h3><a name='g1'></a>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g2'></a>Chapter 2</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g3'></a>Chapter 3</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> And Job spake, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g4'></a>Chapter 4</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g5'></a>Chapter 5</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g6'></a>Chapter 6</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> But Job answered and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g7'></a>Chapter 7</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</p>

<h3><a name='g8'></a>Chapter 8</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</p>

<h3><a name='g9'></a>Chapter 9</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span> Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span> Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span> Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span> Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</p>

<h3><a name='g10'></a>Chapter 10</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</p>

<h3><a name='g11'></a>Chapter 11</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</p>

<h3><a name='g12'></a>Chapter 12</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> And Job answered and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span> Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span> It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span> He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span> For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span> They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</p>

<h3><a name='g16'></a>Chapter 16</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</p>

<h3><a name='g17'></a>Chapter 17</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.</p>

<h3><a name='g19'></a>Chapter 19</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</p>

<h3><a name='g20'></a>Chapter 20</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</p>

<h3><a name='g21'></a>Chapter 21</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> But Job answered and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span> Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span> Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span> The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span> How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span> My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span> If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span> The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span> If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span> Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span> Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span> Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>37</span> I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>38</span> If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.</p>

<h3><a name='g33'></a>Chapter 33</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span> If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span> If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</p>

<h3><a name='g34'></a>Chapter 34</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span> Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span> That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span> Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span> Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span> Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>37</span> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</p>

<h3><a name='g35'></a>Chapter 35</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Elihu spake moreover, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g36'></a>Chapter 36</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Elihu also proceeded, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span> For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span> With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</p>

<h3><a name='g37'></a>Chapter 37</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>35</span> Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.</p>

<h3><a name='g40'></a>Chapter 40</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.</p>

<h3><a name='g41'></a>Chapter 41</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span> He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span> He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span> Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span> He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</p>

<h3><a name='g42'></a>Chapter 42</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> He had also seven sons and three daughters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> So Job died, being old and full of days.</p>
