i don't care.
i have no idea.
i mean it!
i wish i knew!
it doesn't matter.
it doesn't make sense.
it doesn't prove a thing.
it's none of your business.
it's all the same to me.
it's beside the point.
it's new to me.
it's out of place.
it's up to you.
it's waste of time.
let's clear it up.
let's drop the subject.
mind one's own business.
so what?.
that's not the point.
that's very well, but….
use your own judgement.
what are you driving at?.
what are you talking about?.
what for?.
go ahead, do it!
knock yourself out!
this is awkward!
fair enough!
no clue.
not a clue.
story of my life.
that makes two of us.
nice try!
now we’re talking!
take your time.
take as much time as you need.
no rush.
the bottom line is.
i pressed him and he totally caved.
i’ll take my chance.
you got cought.
having said that….
as it is….
no matter.
point of view.
pro and con.
side against.
stand one's ground.
stand to reason.
take a side.
take a stand.
take into account.
