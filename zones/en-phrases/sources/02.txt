ask me another.
come on. let's get this over with.
dear me!
doesn’t matter.
eat one's words.
enough of it.
go into details.
here's what we'll do.
i don't care.
i have no idea.
i mean it!
i meant only the best.
i wish i knew!
if it is no bother.
it beats me.
it doesn't matter.
it doesn't make sense.
it doesn't prove a thing.
it never occurred to me that...
it's none of your business.
it's a lie.
it's all the same to me.
it's beside the point.
it's new to me.
it's out of place.
it's up to you.
it's waste of time.
let's clear it up.
let's drop the subject.
mind one's own business.
no matter
point of view.
pro and con.
take a side.
side against.
take a stand.
so what?
speak one's mind.
stand one's ground.
stand to reason.
take into account.
tend to your own affairs.
that impressive!
that's not the point.
that's very well, but…
think it over.
use your own judgement.
what are you driving at?
what are you talking about?
what for?
what of it?
whatever is to be will be.
you can take it from me.
you are on the right track.
