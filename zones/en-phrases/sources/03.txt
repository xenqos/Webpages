everything's cool!
i'm really buzzing!
i'm having a really peachy time!
i'm walking on air!
i'm on cloud nine!
i'm totally over the moon.
i haven't got a care in the world.
i couldn't care less.
i had a complete fit.
he threw a wobbly.
he blew his top.
there's a bad vibe round here.
get annoyed.
i’m bored to death.
feel miserable about.
beside oneself with.
have half a mind to….
keep cool.
take to heart.
strain at the leash.
sick and tired.
come to one's senses.
