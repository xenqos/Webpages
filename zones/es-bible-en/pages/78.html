<h2>The New Testament</h2>

<h1>The Third Epistle of John</h1>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</p>
