** Part A: ** Reach up and in front of you with both arms and turn your body 90 degrees to your right, pivoting first on your left heel and then on the ball of your right foot. Push down with your hands and bend your knees to lower your weight as though you were sitting down in a chair. (Figures 17.I and 17.2)

** Part B: ** At the bottom of the push, Turn your palms in and cross your forearms at the wrists (left hand inside). As you stand up, bring the right foot in toward the left, until the feet are shoulder width apart, holding the crossed hands away from the body at shoulder height. (Figure 17.3)
