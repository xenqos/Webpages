### Raise & Re-raise

if
  'Player' raises / re-raises
then
  All 'Players' starting from his left clockwise must match 'Raise' / 'Re-raise'. ~~ Thus the betting stops at 'Player' to the right of the one who made 'Raise' / 'Re-raise'
endif

if
  'Players' >= 3 in 'Hand' ('Game')
then
  3-4 'Raise' / 'Re-raise' - allowed
elseif
  'Players' = 2 are in 'Hand' ('Game')
else
  'Raise' / 'Re-raise' - not limited
endif
