## Odds

[!
Relationship of Favorable-Outcomes to Unfavorable-Outcomes
!]

^[probability-odds-outcomes.webp]

**2:4** - two to four
**1:2** - one to two

**1:2** - Odds in Favor of Winning
**2:1** - Odds against Winning

## Probability

[!
Probability Favorable-Outcomes divided by Total-Outcomes
!]

Chance that a given Outcome will happen
Expressed in fraction 0.0 - 1.0
Expressed in percentage 0% - 100%
0.0 / 0% - Outcome will never happen
1.0 / 100% - Outcome will always happen
