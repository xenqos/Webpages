** Part A: ** Shifting your weight to the right foot, cross your arms in front of you (left hand inside). Turn your hips to the right and pivot your left foot on the heel to the right until your feet are in a &#8220;pigeon-toed&#8221; position. Shift your weight back to your left foot, stand up and raise the right knee.

** Part B: ** Extend the right leg in a slow kicking motion. At the same time rotate both hands away from the body, pushing the right palm in the same direction as the right foot is kicking, and pushing the left palm towards the opposite direction. (Figure 94.1)
